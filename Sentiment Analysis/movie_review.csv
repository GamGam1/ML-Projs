"summer catch ( 2001 ) . starring freddie prinze jr .  jessical biel  matthew lillard  fred ward  jason gedrick  brittany murphy  bruce davison and brian dennehy . screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins . story by falls . directed by mike tollin . rated pg-13 . approx . 110 minutes . summer catch is a minor league effort  nine innings of banality with a lineup of stock situations and stereotypical characters . this feature is like a double header  two sets of clichés for the price of one . not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts  but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins  based on a story by falls  merely lobs its plotline at the audience . this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . )  a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league  supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country . ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy . he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous . he also  as we are informed early  his own worst enemy . he has the potential and the talent  but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . so  ryan tries to remained focused on baseball . then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel )  daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures . tenley  a name only a hack screenwriter could invent  is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan . if you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads  then you need a remedial course in film viewing . as always prinze is pretty to look at  but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love  heartbreak  frustration  self-loathing or determination . biel cries a lot  while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father . the only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker  the team's catcher . summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies  such as bull durham and the natural . no curve balls here  no sliders . every pitch is predictable . a blind umpire could call this movie . summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking . it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette  in . he can be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier . com or at bobbloom@iquest . net .  other reviews by bloom can be found at www . jconline . com by clicking on golafayette . bloom's reviews also can be found on the web at the internet movie database : http : //www . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? bob + bloom

"as you should know  this summer has been less than memorable . with a total of 4 decent films  it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . with that said  you can pretty much predict what my opinion on "" the 13th warrior "" will be . the film is based on the michael crichton "" eaters of the dead ""  in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . after tarveling for many months  he comes across a gang of norsemen  who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . so  they start picking men  and are left without 1  thus ahmed is choosen . so far it sounds interesting right ? not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . after that  they basically run around killing . that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film  because once your story is introduced  you have the rest of the film to start developing it . obviously that's not the case here . even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure  you will be disappointed . since all the action takes place in fog  it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances  and to poor camera work . can't the camera men sit still ? i'd like to actually watch a film in focus  but again  they failed to deliver that as well . the film moves on and on until the point  where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating . with corny dialogue  that the characters laugh at for some odd reason  a script that goes nowhere  dull action sequences  a predictable ending  and worst of all weak characters  there's basically nothing to like here  except for maybe the set designs . that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest . when i heard that john mctiernan  the director  wanted his name kept out of the project  that made me wonder why ? well now i know . crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product  which led to a big arguement . what's there to argue about anyway ? the film couldn't be saved  no matter how much they spent or casted . seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money  i wouldn't be surprised to see "" the 13th warrior "" become a hit . please do me a favor and save your money at all costs  or else you will be lost in the fog  like the film itself .

"back in the early years of his career  eddie murphy was afflicted with what roger ebert termed "" star magic syndrome ""  where a hot young star is shoved blindly into one ill-conceived production after another  in the hopes that name-brand recognition will make up for shoddy writing or inept concepts . after the surefooted fun of doctor doolittle and the nutty professor  holy man is a step back to the golden child for murphy . murphy plays a guru/swami-type figure named g ( yes  just "" g "" -- [g]andhi ? [g]autama ? we never find out )  whose idea of mysticism is parlor tricks and whose expoundings on philosophy are torn wholesale from sub-robert bly self-help books . he's the kind of character that desperately needs an edge  a twist . i kept thinking back to my own readings on zen buddhism  in which the masters slapped their disciples around mercilessly  insulted them  posed impossible riddles  and did all kinds of other off-the-wall things in the name of enlightenment . no two ways about it : g is boring . g wanders into the lives of two tv execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston )  who are the manufactured romance for the movie . they're a little unnerved by this guy  even when he repairs the flat tires on their car . every time they look at g  their faces seem to say something like : "" what if he's one of those wackos who insinuates themselves into your life and kills your dog ? "" now right there is something more interesting than anything that actually happens in the movie . see  the execs are in charge of a rapidly-failing home shopping network which hawks various utterly unsellable products . they desperately need to revamp things . one day  on a whim  g wanders onto the set and does his thing -- and suddenly  merchandise is blowing out the door ! this guy's a kick-butt salesman ! this leads to him getting his own show ( named  with agonizing predictability  "" the g spot "" ) . why isn't any of this funny ? probably because we can see it coming a billion miles away . nothing happens in this movies because it's human nature -- certainly not the cardboard romance  which has preston and goldblum fighting  making up and getting back together in scenes of leaden predictability . and g isn't a counterpoint to anything : he's his own straight man . he has a bunch of unedifying little speeches and one long one that's not only unedifying  but dishonest  because it's a parable that we've heard way too many times before . the writer  tom schulman  has indulged in this kind of sappiness before . he penned the insufferable dead poets society  which indulged in the insincere fiction that poetry and writing need to be "" sold "" to students with flashy technique instead of cherished on their own . here  he's no better : he gives g nothing of importance to do  surrounds him with a setup that's bloodless and uninvolving  and fills his mouth with thimble-deep pop-psych blather . suggestions for the rewrite : either ditch the romance or make it more bloodthirsty . and as for g  give him some actual attitude instead of just a smile . here's one role where eddie murphy should actually have let the more scatological  scabrous side of his personality out of the closet . failing that  maybe they should have case chris tucker . he would have been funny just standing there in swami pajamas .

"the modern use of the western movie  and the western genre has almost evaporated . even cowgirls get the blues and wild wild west are some of the most recent entries  both of them were bad  and this one is coming right along to join them . what starts out like a promising desert film ( martin scorsese is one of the producers ) turns into boring drech . pete calder ( crudup  who was steve prefontaine in without limits ) is new to hi-lo  new mexico . he's here to start his cattle business and quickly makes friends with  oh  the western version of woody harrelson ( and  what a surprise  he's played by woody harrelson ) his name is big boy and he's in the same business . the two men constantly go to the bar  and celebrate the death of a man that they beat in poker . when mona ( patricia arquette ) crosses through both of their lives  they are both lovestruck and each of them begin their own private affairs . the men struggle to keep their bonds alive while they are constantly drunk  herding cattle  and making crude sexual references . ( if this doesn't sound like a classic western you're right . ) the film follows the two men's lives until one character dies  by the time we get there  we don't really care . there are three problems in the hi-lo country . one  harrelson seems to have his role written exactly for him . rather than seeing harrelson's big boy character when i looked on the screen  i saw woody harrelson playing the same type of woody-ized character that he always plays . this also goes for arquette  who's role seems patricia-ized for her and reminded me constantly of her alice character in lost highway . two  the film is boring . so boring in fact  that i believe my minutes of film to yawn ratio is 6 : 2 . three  the film plays in no particular order  showing us a handful of random events that don't have any meaning to what happens in the conclusion . add some sappy drama  and you've got another bad western  the hi-lo country gets  stars .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- at the end of the day  those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening  where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . and with good reason . this is a joyless exercise of a film  held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement  thrills or wit . remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving  the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance  joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . ( indeed  both films even feature appalling  ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) uma thurman  who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad  karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg  was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster  imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . unfortunately  the same can't be said here  where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed  taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever  fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . at this rate  usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is  more than most  heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch  and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat  i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no  not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me )  but gwyneth paltrow  who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . if nothing else  it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . the story  such as it is  involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery )  an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors  it sounds far better than it plays  and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . the avengers was never about gripping drama  and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously  but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac  it's all decidedly uncompelling . mr . connery  who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression  approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation  simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . at least it all looks good . this is a genuinely handsome production  with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . in particular  the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention  adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film  including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water  but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . by the time the film's climax had arrived  my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain  but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . not coincidentally  the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer  a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . it's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy  clever  engaging  and entertaining . a crushing disappointment  the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad  too polished to overlook its deficiencies . there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers  but i sure hope not .

"running time : 1 hour 35 minutes starring kurt russell  j . t walsh and kathleen quinlan directed by jonathan mostow breakdown is an moderately entertaining  if underwhelming  thriller . kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor  taking the scenic route to california through redneck country . however  while in the middle of nowhere  their jeep decides to break down  leaving them stranded . a friendly truck driver  warren ( walsh )  offers to give them a lift to town . although jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car )  amy agrees  hops into warren's lorry  and promptly disappears . jeff wonders where the hell she is  and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life  the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife . although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise  the latter two are far superior character and script wise . kurt russell is o . k as jeff  although he can seemingly only pull of one expression  which is angry . throughout the whole film  he looks angry ( or just pissed off . ) quinlan is o . k again  but again she can only pull off one expression  which is looking dorky . throughout the whole film  she looks dorky . j . t walsh ( who  sadly  recently passed away ) is fine as warren ( who we soon find out is a kidnapper ) although his actual character is pretty weak  and not really menacing enough . the supporting cast do their best aswell  with rex linn as a doubting sheriff  and the other kidnappers . the story  written by first-timer jonathan mostow ( who also directs ) is o . k  if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid . some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy . there are some flaws with the plot also  as the characters do the complete opposite to logical ( presumably to keep the story 'exciting' ) and also the fact that the story just isn't strong enough to sustain the audience's attention . the picture moves along very slowly also . it almost threatens to drop dead . the picture does pick up towards the end  but by then it's too late . mostow directs the action sequences well enough  however . the film doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion  either . the ending tries to be bleak  but just comes off annoying . breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director . instead  it just turns out to be merely average . a missed opportunity . overall rating= review by david wilcock david wilcock david . wilcock@btinternet . com visit the wilcock movie page ! http : //wilcockmovie . home . ml . org -or- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/9061 recieve wilcock movie page reviews via e-mail send a blank e-mail to wmp-reviews-subscribe@makelist . com to join the mailing list !

"the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) . year after year  more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . i thought stripes would be different . with ivan reitman as director  bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter  it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . instead  it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . murray  about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs  plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success  and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . so he does  and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell  head-shaving and marching/singing sequences  more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . the characters are even less original  ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame  rehashed material and are never really likeable  murray in particular . he only gets a few decent lines in  although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . he was even better in caddyshack  for crying out loud . as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies  stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women  but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition "" dear god ! "" every few seconds . stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy  either . most of the time it seems downright misogynistic  as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m . p . onto the stove and  with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face  says he's going to give her the "" aunt jemima treatment  "" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . you don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . "" i'm not enjoying this  "" the woman protests . my sentiments exactly .

"director :   woody allen cast :   hank azaria  kenneth branagh  judy davis  leonardo dicaprio  melanie griffith  famke janssen  michael lerner  joe mantegna  winona ryder  charlize theron  dylan baker  screenplay :   woody allen producer :   jean doumanian runtime :    113 min . us distribution : miramax rated r :   language  sex  drug use copyright 1998 nathaniel r . atchesonif you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke  why bother releasing it to the general public ? if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen  then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? while watching celebrity  i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself  living in a world that he's familiar with  dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture  in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . branagh plays lee simon  a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife  robin ( judy davis )  shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen  charlize theron  winona ryder )  and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith  leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . the usual elements of recent allen films are all here  including the sexual insecurity of the main character  lots of self-loathing women  and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally  it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . aside from all the in-jokes  the story falls far short of compelling  and the characters are all empty and lifeless . branagh proves once again that he's a superb performer  nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . the problem is that he's the same character allen always plays  a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch . i mean  come on  how many times have you seen this guy ? -- he hates his work  and he can't be satisfied by any one woman  and  at the end of the movie  nothing has been solved . he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio  and other such stunts )  so it's pretty hard to care about him . in addition  isn't allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him ? i know he is  but he didn't do it in celebrity . the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . davis  playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry  has a few touching moments  but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder  especially -- but they're not likable people . only famke janssen  as a book editor interested in simon's new novel  has any life . the men in the picture don't do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin  while dicaprio  as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor  is funny but disengaging . what's really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its "" themes "" are . allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie about the way "" normal "" people look at celebrities . the main problem with this is that the character with whom we're supposed to identify  simon  is not a "" normal "" guy -- he's just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic  interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . in addition  allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin  in this scene  says something like  "" it's interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! "" ) . celebrity is arguably allen's biggest misfire to date . it does have a few good scenes -- theron's super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny  and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . but celebrity is a failure at the core  unless allen's point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke  then he succeeded in that . i  for one  don't enjoy feeling like an outsider .

"rated r starring claire danes  omar epps  giovanni ribisi  dennis farina  josh brolin  steve harris  michael lerner  richard jenkins written by stephen t . kay  scott silver  and kate lanier directed by scott silver about five minutes into scott silver's awful the mod squad  i had already made up my mind to leave the theater . but just as i was getting out of my chair  a feeling hit me . maybe by the end of this review  i'll know what that feeling was . now i know that in most of my reviews i reserve the second paragraph to describe the plot  but i looked hard at the mod squad and couldn't find one . those of you who watched the 60's tv series on which this film is based know that the "" mod squad "" is a group of three young criminals ( claire danes  omar epps  giovanni ribisi ) who are sent out to become undercover cops . in this two hour long episode ( hmm  maybe the show wasn't this bad ) they are sent out by their boss ( dennis farina ) to execute some kind of drug bust . the funny thing is that there is not one engaging plot twist to be found at all . for some reason though  when i decided not to walk out  i became oddly drawn towards the screen . in no way was i engrossed in the experience  but there was something subtle in the film that begged me to like it even the slightest bit . i mean  the film at least lookd great  thanks to some great cinematography by ellen kuras and three very fresh-looking young faces . each one of these actors has shown incredible potential in their prior film outings . get danes  epps  and ribisi together in a film with a decent script and i'll be first in line to see it . and somebody please give giovanni ribisi a good role ! how come the brat pack from suburbia ( steve zahn  giovanni ribisi  parker posey  ajay naidu ) is all of a sudden selling out . suburbia's one of my favorite movies for g-d's sake ! as you can tell by now  i have gone off topic in this very personal review of the mod squad  but i have finally figured out what made me sit through it . i ended up feeling sorry not for any character in the film  but for the entire production itself . review by akiva gottlieb  the teenage movie critic akiva@excite . com http : //www . angelfire . com/mo/film watch me on tbs' "" dinner and a movie may 21  8 : 05pm est get your free  private email at http : //mail . excite . com/

"united states  1998 u . s . release date : 5/8/98 ( wide ) running length : 1 : 20 mpaa classification : r ( profanity  mature themes  sexual situations ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 cast : jada pinkett smith  tommy davidson  dave chappelle  paula jai parker  ll cool j  darrel heath  michael ralph  duane martin director : daisy v . s . mayer producers : beth hubbard  michael hubbard screenplay : david c . johnson cinematography : jean lepine music : michel colombier u . s . distributor : new line cinema working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . despite being one of the freshest talents available  pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame  the nutty professor ) . the problem is  of course  that there aren't many good roles available for black women . take away the likes of waiting to exhale  set it off  soul food  and eve's bayou  and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend  a local whore  or a murder victim . as a result  for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee  she is stuck in a stupid  formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . actually  woo  the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . mayer ( party girl )  could have been worse than it is . the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . unfortunately  huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . the situations are painfully contrived  the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms  and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of "" free lobotomy "" lab experiment . woo is a spontaneous  energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . her latest relationship  with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer  came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . now  her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr . right  and that he'll be a virgo . later that day  woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim  a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order  who just happens to be a virgo . it's not love at first sight  however . things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass  and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a "" quiet "" dinner . in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures  there have been a ton of bad "" white "" movies about mismatched lovers  so i suppose it's only fair that we get a "" black "" effort of the same low caliber . as in all romantic comedies  we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . the question is  are their courtship rituals entertaining ? in a good entry to the genre  the audience becomes caught up in the love story  no matter how familiar it is . in woo  the constant reliance upon unfunny  moronic humor sinks the project . for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes  there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . sadly  that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences  and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . despite exuding charm from every pore  there's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson's script . since it misses the mark by so much  a better name for woo might have been whoops .

"the formula is simple . trap a varied group of people on an isolated location  then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one . these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing  alien  aliens  and tremors to name a few ) . so  why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . ) perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas . deep rising meets these two requirements part way  but not enough to salvage the film . treat williams is finnegan  the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no questions asked . this time  however  they may have gone too far . their passengers  led by the ominous wes studi  are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films . and their cargo . . . let's just say it has very high explosive potential . what is the target of these thieves ? why  the argonauticus  of course  a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . but something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something ancient and deadly . by the time the thieves arrive  nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . and now the creature senses fresh meat ! so  you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew  joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald )  and a thief with less lofty goals  trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . and the monster gets to pick them off one by one . fortunately for the creature  this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . if there's a more clarion call for unity  i don't know what it might be . it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . for the most part  the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) treat williams is a passable hero  and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy  very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . the biggest treat in the film  however  has to be pantucci  kevin j . o'connor's whining engine-boy  under finnegan's employ . his constant quips may be a bit over-written  but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss  for that matter ) . it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character )  but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . as far as the monster goes  although the cgi is done well  the creature has no logical consistency . think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . they all had a set of "" rules "" about what they could do  and how and why they would do it . part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering  along with the heroes  just what those rules are . the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn't have a set of rules . . . or if it does  not a very good one . it merely eats ( or drinks  as the case may be )  and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . it simply happens . the action scenes are decent  but few are noteworthy . the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . deep rising's peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron's ( but can you really blame them ) . unfortunately  deep rising's efforts are more on par with speed 2 . on the plus side  however  the film's closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . perhaps you'd be better off waiting for that one .

"wild wild west ( pg ) . ( warner bros/village roadshow ) director : barry sonnenfeld stars : will smith  kevin kline  kenneth branagh  salma hayek  ted levine  m emmett walsh  frederique van der wal  musetia vander  sofia eng  bai ling  rodney a grant running time : 106 minutes . hollywood again proves that it has lost the plot with yet another misguided attempt at bringing a forgotten '60's tv series to the screen . wild wild west followed the exploits of a pair of secret government agents who travelled across the wild frontier by train thwarting threats against the country . this big screen version ultimately seems little more than a camp  second rate bond-like adventure set against the background of the old west . from the outset  with its fresh  hip hop take on the familiar theme music  it's clear that this new look wild wild west is far removed from the original tv series  and clearly determined to follow its own slightly modern path . a horribly miscast will smith ( enemy of the people  etc ) steps into the robert conrad role of james west  president grant's top secret agent . although the film is set in the years immediately following the civil war  the thought of a black man venturing unobtrusively through the frontier and battling villainous plots is a little too incredible to swallow . the film is set in 1869  several years after the destructive and divisive civil war has left its scars on the fledgling nation's psyche . long presumed dead  the embittered and crippled dr arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) re-emerges from hiding  driven by a megalomaniacal lust for power . he has conceived a preposterous plot to dismantle the union and return the various states to their previous owners . he has kidnapped several notable scientists  and forced them to work on his ultimate weapon of mass destruction - actually a giant mechanical spider which stomps across the frontier blasting towns into oblivion - in the hope of blackmailing president grant into agreeing to his demands . enter west ( smith ) and artemus gordon ( kevin kline )  two of grant's top agents  who are forced into a reluctant partnership to thwart loveless's diabolical scheme . west is an impulsive man of action who shoots first  while gordon is a more thoughtful but somewhat eccentric agent  with a penchant for disguises and clever inventions that are ahead of their time . this odd couple pairing follows a predictable formula  although their relationship brings an almost contemporary sensibility to this unorthodox western . the pair spark a number of laughs along the way  with plenty of snappy one-liners and some risque humour . the best gags though are the visual ones  in particular a series of sly in-jokes depicting some contemporary cultural icons . the film starts off promisingly enough  but degenerates into camp farce with the arrival of the legless loveless and his amazon army . branagh's performance is all corn-ball humour and dreary accent and bad jokes  and he hardly establishes a menacing presence . smith brings an arrogant attitude to the role  but his performance lends a contemporary flavour to the character . kline actually plays a dual role here  appearing both as gordon and as president grant  and he brings a nice comic edge to his performance . although smith and kline develop a good rapport and work well together  they deserve better material . the vivacious salma hayek is wasted in thankless  exploitive role that doesn't really allow her to do much . director barry sonnenfeld ( men in black  etc ) is a dab hand with the spectacular effects and gimmickry on display  but somehow the whole thing lacks credibility and a genuine sense of excitement . with this often silly mix of western action and high-tech gadgetry  sonnenfeld and his team of gun writers  which includes s s wilson and brent maddock ( short circuit  etc ) and jeffrey price and peter s seaman ( who framed roger rabbit ?  etc )  seem unsure of their target audience . like the b-grade  megalomaniacal bond villain of the piece  this lame attempt to revive the '60's television series lacks any sort of legs  and fails to last the distance . tame tame west is more like it !

"mortal kombat : annihilation starring : robin shou ( liu kang )  tailsa soto ( princess kitana ) directed by : john r . leonetti  written by : brent v . friedman and bryce zabel from a story by lawrence kasanoff  john tobias  and joshua wexler . rated pg-13 by the mpaa for some strong language and plenty of violence  mostly of the martial arts variety . * bah-buh-bah-bah-buhbuh  bah-buh-bah-bah-bahbuh  bah-bah-bah-buh-bahbuh  bah-bah-buhbahbuhbuhbah * okay  so chances are you've heard that now-famous outcry and the techno music that follows it  either on commercials for the movies  or the video games  or on the soundtracks for the games or movies  or in the movies themselves . in this  the sequel to the original mortal kombat film  titled mortal kombat : annihilation  that theme music is still intact  and  just like the last time  bolts into our ears right from the new line cinema logo . however  it's almost the only thing that's still around from the first film . in order to review mortal kombat : annihilation  one must have an opinion of the original  since this essentially just tries to be more of the same . okay . i truly liked mortal kombat . yes  i really did . maybe the plot was sort of basic  but it was * fun * . it was one of the most * fun * movies of the summer of 1995 . it had some funny dialouge  some appealing actors ( and some not-so-much )  some nice effects  plenty of extremely well-choreographed martial arts battles  and a cool  pumping soundtrack . and  of course  it was directed very well by the talented paul anderson  who could have a great career as long as he avoids crap like event horizon from now on . now the sequel is upon us . the martial arts battles aren't as well choreographed  but they're still pretty good . unfortunately  the directing is nowhere near as good as in the original  and it dilutes the quality of the fights . the villian isn't nearly as imposing  many of the original actors have been replaced for the worse  the effects might have been impressive in 1992  it's filled with extraneous subplots and characters  and  well  basically this movie just plain sucks . robin shou is honestly trying here . you can tell . he wants this to really not suck . sandra hess wants to have an acting career  that's obvious . . . so it's good news for her that she's better than the original actress behind sonya blade ( bridgette wilson ) . in fact  she's not bad at all . i wouldn't mind horribly if i saw her again . . . in some other film  of course . talisa soto seems sort of bored with this . she obviously beefed up her martial arts training  but when she's acting  she's rather stiff  just like in the original . of course  that's kitana's character for you  i guess . as a side note  her sudden romance with liu kang is utterly ludicrous  and has no place here - it's just another piece of excess baggage for the plot to carry . the only person putting forth anything resembeling effort is litefoot  who plays nightwolf  at least for the whopping two minutes that he's on the screen . this guy deserves better . james remar replaces christopher lambert as rayden  and does a shoddy job . lambert was perfect for this role . however  remar isn't given much to work with here  anyway . our villian  shao kahn ( brian thompson ) shouts a lot  but that doesn't mean he's threatening . kahn's father is more interesting  but doesn't do much . johnny cage  the most fun of the characters in the original  is played by another actor as well ( linden ashby is having fun doing "" melrose place "" by now )  and is killed in the first five minutes . this is pure idiocy at work  people . there's no reason for his death . it just opens up for another comic relief character to appear  jax  played by lynn "" red "" williams  previously known as "" sabre "" on american gladiators . he gets a few funny lines  but is no where near as amusing as johnny cage was . williams just tries too hard to be will smith . he seems to have some talent buried in him that briefly shines through here and there  but overall  it's not really on display here . tons of characters show up for no reason  and bring up sub-plots that have no point . one example is when sub-zero ( keith cooke ) appears . he states that the sub-zero that liu kang killed in the original was his brother  and that a robot  smoke  has been reprogrammed to go after kang  instead of original target  sub-zero himself . why was the robot going after subbie ? why was it reprogrammed ? why did sub-zero bother to save kang ? why did he take up the mantle of his brother ? how does he do those cool ice manuvers ? why do none of the writers of this movie care to tell us any of this ? sub-zero is off the screen about three minutes after he appears  and never comes back . what was the point ? other characters  like rain ( tyrone wiggins ) and mileena ( dana hee )  pop up in gaudy costumes and don't even last the three minutes that sub-zero does . and who honestly cares about the woman that shows up calling herself jade ( irina pantaeva ) ? this is worse than the "" street fighter "" movie's overflow of characters . what were they thinking ? considering the advancements in effects since the original kombat  it's also distressing that the effects in this sequel are rather shoddy . in fact  we had some movies that had better cgi effects back in 1992  such as terminator 2 and alien 3 . oh well . some things in this movie seemed to be tossed in just because they allowed the chance for cheesy effects . c'mon  did we really need that lame "" animality "" sub-plot ? at least the soundtrack succeeds in doing what the original's did : it makes hard rock and techno sound good and fun by setting it to martial arts battles  and making those genres of music sound good is not a horribly easy feat . but still  the original's is better . overall  this is just another bad sequel . it's about on the level of this year's batman & robin  and that's really a shame . the whole plot is a jumble - it's tough to care much about what's going on . the first one was fun  but this is just a big mess . it looks like 1995's mortal kombat remains the only truly * good * video game-based film so far . the mistakes here are so obvious . this should've been better .

"tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers  all searching for deeper meaning . however  they won't find much meaning in the real blonde  and not enough real humor  either . joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor  or he claims to be one  even though he has no credits under his belt . his girlfriend  mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she's a makeup artist  working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month  sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . sahara  who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid  has an on-again  off-again relationship with joe's best friend  bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . however  bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah )  who may be that illusive woman he's always pursued : a real blonde . there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde  but not enough . the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background  such as sahara's perfume ads : "" depression - it's not just a state of mind "" . but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel . and  unfortunately  the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . take for example the film's framing device of an old lady and her dog . the story serves absolutely no purpose  makes little sense  and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie . matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film  but they're stuck in the most boring plotlines . modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley  who appears as another struggling actor . keener's character has a stronger edge  but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary  no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense . the movie's running time is under two hours  but it seems like it is well over it . there's just not enough humor to speed things along  and not enough meaning to propel any drama .

"there are some actors that you just look at and will automatically see them as the famous character they play . fran drescher will forever will the nanny  bob denver will always be gilligan  and don knotts lives forever as barney fife . all these people are television actors who appear on their show  week after week playing the same character  so it is hard for this to translate into celebrities who appear in movies . anthony hopkins on the other hand apparently wants us to always think of him as a crazed madman behind bars . this is the only reason i could come up with for him to take the leading role in instinct  a new movie that re-defines cliched and painful . it does not matter if the prison inmates are tough praying on the few weak ones  or that the guards give new meaning to police brutality . you could probably withstand all of the above material on a good bucket of popcorn and a very large soda . but the movie can't even be even fun and smart on a summer movie level  and fails miserably to make us excited or scared in any way . dr . theo calder is a young psychologist who is very high in the areas of self-confidence and self-assurance . he wants to begin seeing a crazed scientist who recently was transported from a prison in africa to one in the states . ethan powell ( hopkins  playing the role of hannibal lecterâs non-cannibal cousin ) was a scientist who disappeared in the forests of africa in 1994 . he lived in the forest with the gorillas he studies for two years before killing two park rangers and injuring two more while trying to protect his gorilla family . in the first interview theo learns some problems that may hinder the investigation of ethan . one  he doesn't speak to anyone at all . two  he hasn't experienced human interaction in so long he responds to almost everything with violent outbursts . three  the doctors at the prison just don't care . how dramatic  how thrilling  how ( inserting snoring sounds here ) . eventually he does get the man to finally utter a few words  but the psychiatrist soon finds himself to be the one whoâs being taught a lesson . thereâs some message about how no human actually has control  they just think they do  that is what powell teaches him . dr . calder soon expands his horizons as a realizes that is may not be the people in the prison  but the prison itself . the problems with the inmates must live with are guards that are not fair to them and treat them with harshly and violently . plus  oh my god ! everyone in the prison is not being treated with proper respect . ok  let us take a poll : who would ever really care about what happens to any of the people in this movie ? see it and if you donât come out disgusted then i will personally pay for your next outing to the cinema . ( note : the preceding sentence was just to prove a point that this movie is bad  i will not pay for your next movie so donât e-mail me asking for money . ) the acting in the film is just horrible . hopkins does nothing in the role that he is accustomed to  and cuba has some keen intellectual ability to pick bad roles that will make him lose his star status . this is not entirely the actorâs faults though . the script could easily have been written better if the proper time was taken with it . the soapy emotion that floats up near the end of the film also doesnât make any sense with all of the happenings in the beginning of the picture . the setting is uninteresting and the story has too many side plots that they do nothing with which just seem to be there to add to the running time . you could rip up all of the copies ( with gloves on so as not to burn your fingers ) of this movie at your local video store . you could warn people who try to rent it  or you could make a big bonfire and burn all of the copies in the neighborhood . whatever you can do to help make sure that no one on earth will ever have to experience this film ( i believe ) would be greatly appreciated by the american public . so if you havenât gotten the message yet  avoid instinct  which gets 1/2 a * . the young-uns : the film contains some suspenseful scenes and strong language . it is also senselessly brutal and violent in some scenes . good age : no one who is sober/anyone who liked chill factor a review by frankie paiva the 12 year-old movie reviewer e-mail me at swpstke@aol . com visit my website at http : //www . homestead . com/teenagemoviecritic/mainpage . html

"directed by mark tarlov . cast : sarah michelle gellar  sean patrick flanery  patricia clarkson  christopher durang  larry gilliard jr .  dylan baker  betty buckley . 1999 - 95 minutes . rated pg-13 ( for profanity ) . reviewed february 6  1999 . blatantly borrowing elements from 1993's "" like water for chocolate "" and 1991's "" the butcher's wife  "" "" simply irresistible "" attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but  more often than not  comes off as laughable  leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v . 's "" buffy  the vampire slayer "" ) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on . things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda ( sarah michelle gellar )  a young woman who runs her late family's struggling new york restaurant  runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air . while out shopping  she also meets tom ( sean patrick flanery )  a charming  handsome man  who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for  and later when he decides to drop by her dive  called southern cross  for lunch  she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him  even though she is known to not be a very good chef . suddenly  amanda finds her restaurant  on the edge of foreclosure  rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food  which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths . are amanda and tom destined to be together ? and is it not just because of the magical food  but because they really  truly like each other ? and what exactly is going on with the food she is making ? does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation ? "" simply irresistible "" is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that's as flimsy as a slice of bologna . it takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes . add in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie  which certainly tells you something about the film itself )  and what you've got is an utterly empty  if not necessarily boring  excursion . the cast of "" simply irresistible "" is fairly good  but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting . patricia clarkson ( 1998's "" high art  "" in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as tom's colleague  and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue . also of note is larry gilliard jr .  as amanda's cooking assistant and buddy  who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes . of the main stars  sarah michelle gellar is fine  but really does often look like she's struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material  and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future  he has certainly got to pick better projects than this . the bottom line is that "" simply irresistible "" is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title  and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene )  my mind checked out from the characters and the romance . when i think about it in hindsight  i should have checked out in the very first scene  where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab . now  that certainly is what i'd call magical ! - copyright 1999 by dustin putmam http : //hometown . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html

"new year  new pile of movies straight from the hollywood dumping ground of badly test-screened  obscure  unfunny  and badly acted garbage . double take is the first pony out of the gate . i don't know which is the worst part of the film : eddie griffin's overacting  orlando jones' non-acting  or the ugly mutt that passes as griffin's sidekick . orlando jones does a better job in those 7-up commercials than in the role of darryl chase  an uptight investment banker set up by a combination of the cia  the fbi  a mexican drug cartel  the federales  and an emu farmer as part of a double murder/embezzlement scheme . running from the law  chase changes clothes and identity with freddy tiffany  a two-bit hustler named played by eddie griffin he encounters on the street . together  the pair travel across the country to mexico  where a certain cia agent holds the key to chase's freedom . and of course  during the journey  darryl chase rediscovers his roots as a black man while freddy tiffany shucks and jives his way through every situation like he's the bastard son of eddie murphy and jerry lewis . after numerous car chases  way too many plot "" twists  "" the aforementioned annoying dog  the bad acting of vivica a . fox  and too many jokes about a glass eye  the movie becomes a science project left in the school refrigerator to rot over the summer . orlando jones  a genuinely talented actor/writer  seems out of place here  annoyed by the film and especially by his costar's lack of acting ability . griffin has the energy of tito puente  the humor of richard pryor  and the acting ability of former seattle seahawks linebacker brian bosworth . jones deserves better material and collaborators . it's a shame that double take is as bad as it is  because this cinematic travesty was written and directed by george gallo  the screenwriter of one of the funniest films of the 1980's  midnight run ( the plot of which bears a striking similarity to this film ) . here are a few bonus facts to consider if you haven't bought my evaluation : the film is based on an obscure 1950's english film starring rod steiger called across the bridge . it took more than a decade to get the green light for production . it describes itself as a cross between "" film noir  a thriller  and a comedy .

"" can't hardly wait "" just opts for a big indoor keg party  and a little bit of aimless driving  albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand . we follow many people around  but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry  of "" that thing you do ! "" )  the alienated writer  who's been pining over the homcoming queen  amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt )  for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend  mike ( peter facinelli )  he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his "" love "" for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film  and because it's a party  there are some more main characters  such as : william ( charlie korsmo  finally surfacing after "" dick tracy "" )  the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike  who's humiliated him for years  but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green )  the wigger  who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise  the only exceptional character  who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . ugh . the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not "" american grafitti "" or "" dazed and confused  "" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining )  but to john hughes films of the 80s  most notably "" sixteen candles . "" the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters  and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . this film forgets to satirize its characters  and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and then says that it's all okay . we can't take this film seriously  nor can we take this as fun  so really what good is it ? but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction  except for a couple too-over-the-top features  like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . generally  though  elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement  and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note  though  is too hokey to really be admirable ) . i actually did like seth green  for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in "" radio days "" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . and  of course  lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise  the one character we could have used some more of  even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . however  the character of denise really doesn't work with the film  when really thought about . she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film  and whenever she appears  she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . she may ruin the film more  but at least when she's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves "" well  at least we'll be entertained . "" a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character  who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless  bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work  but nice try . basically the worst thing about this film  the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating  is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do . we don't feel for these characters because for most of us  we aren't stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it's portraying ? the answer for this film is no . nice try  though .

"in dreams reviewed by jamie peckrating :  dreamworks skg / 1 : 40 / 1999 / r ( violence  language ) cast : annette bening ; aidan quinn ; stephen rea ; robert downey jr . ; paul guilfoyle director : neil jordan screenplay : bruce robinson ; neil jordan  "" in dreams "" might keep you awake at night  but not because of its creepy imagery  bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . no  the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential  the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . the big letdown  however  comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan  the man behind "" the crying game . "" he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness  but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . things start out strong enough  with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic  seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish  it's this one . don't knock the look  but say what you will about the foolish plot  underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . annette bening  another asset "" in dreams "" shouldn't be so lucky to boast  gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return . she plays claire cooper  a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible  soon-to-be-committed crimes  but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . this being a thriller  we know that she is  in fact  on the money  and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims  "" in dreams "" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . subplots appear and disappear . when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . )  it turns out his name is vivian  he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama  a la norman bates . "" in dreams "" reaches its absurdist zenith here  and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . some questions  then : what's with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? what about the computer ? does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? is the woman in australia integral to anything ? and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? sigh . at least in my own dreams  i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste . © 1999 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ "" like so many horror films  this one is set on a national holiday - the fourth of july . christmas and graduation day are also popular  although thanksgiving now seems reserved for movies about dysfunctional families .

"senseless ( r )  ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian  and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . alas  moments are simply that  moments  which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise . granted  that one joke is initially amusing . when wayans's darryl witherspoon  an economics major at stratford university  hits some dire financial straits  he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses  darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . at this point  the film sounds more like senseful than senseless  but through some turns of the plot  darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once  essentially leaving him--yes--senseless . this sets up some showcase moments for wayans's gift for physical comedy  especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely  hilariously limp . but these gags  and the gag behind the entire movie  quickly grows stale . once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses  instead of exploring any new comic territory  director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness . wayans approaches each go-round with gusto  but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration . senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . however  the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family  and this "" serious "" angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . unlike wayans's last starring vehicle  the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man  the "" emotional "" content of senseless is forced and unconvincing . any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl's romance with janice ( tamara taylor )  a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself  does not generate sparks of any kind . once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end  the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him . but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless  his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother  damon  who is now set to make his comeback--on television .

"susan granger's review of "" jeepers creepers "" ( mgm/ua entertainment ) this nasty  little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . when long decides to investigate  there's nothing but trouble . "" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? - well  this is it ! "" philips warns . what he finds in the basement of an old  abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying  jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel  plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies  stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . long flees but now the monstrous  winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle  a psychic who explains the evil creature's bizarre feeding habits . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10  "" jeepers creepers "" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion  giving new meaning to the old song "" jeepers creepers . "" and now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . what's more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california . sentenced to three years in prison  he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . when salva made "" powder "" ( 1995 )  the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities  disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . and now  once again  in this mgm/ua film  that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio .

"" ) . the killing starts before the train even leaves the station . since it's new year's  everyone's wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we've seen before )  and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one's looking . at least one of the characters says it's a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard  it looks like gene shalit who  by the way  would make a great killer in a slasher movie . speaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene  one of terror train's most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield "" as the magician  "" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music . then there's his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that . for all its attempts at visual style and substance  terror train is more lionel than amtrak  more prom night than halloween  and nothing really worth watching . only die-hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it . and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse . i mean  when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station  anyway ? terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1  000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

"written and directed by guy ferland based on a short story by robert coover starring alicia silverstone  jeremy london  j . t . walsh rated r ( contains violence  profanity  and brief nudity ) 90 minutes synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend  who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . while this is going on  the thug  the father  the boyfriend  and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . suspense ? family drama ? humor ? erotica ? elements of each of these genres exist in the film  yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . instead  the babysitter is a dull  lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer  the babysitter . her character has absolutely no depth at all  and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies . everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . the father ( played by j . t . walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend . none of these fantasy sequences  trust me  are things that need to be seen  but we see them anyway  complete with cheesy  make-out saxophone music . the thug  in the meantime  proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . the most absurd character  however  is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . the thug  in a manipulative  iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard )  manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking  smoking grass  running away from cops  and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . incredible ! ( of course  the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was  try not to laugh  to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful  then it fails . there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film  and nearly all of them come at the final minute . by that time  however  the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous  then it also fails . i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed  at times  to be played for laughs . if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic  then  once again  it fails . the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . finally  if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning )  then it fails as well . the dream sequences aren't erotic ; they are too brief and  outside of one very short scene  contain no nudity . i can't completely trash this movie . the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film  and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . the other 79 minutes  though  are a drag . silverstone's character  at the end of the movie  turns to her boyfriend and asks "" what were you thinking ? "" i asked myself the same question  having spent 99 cents renting this turkey .

"movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain . in the best of all possible worlds  they accomplish both . on the red planet  they fail entirely . in the near future  a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth . this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be . after some mumbo-jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet  the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does . the ground crew of people you couldn't care less about is trapped on the surface without food  water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog . the one potentially interesting character ( carrie-anne moss ) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer . attempting to graft "" 2001 "" esque space mysticism with "" terminator "" robot horror  first time director antony hoffman can't seem to figure out what's going on . neither can we . didn't he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story ? couldn't he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter ? there are so many mis-steps . every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction . why introduce the theme of faith vs . science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ ? the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen . two hours later  they're still waiting . despite our greatest hopes  there is no life on the red planet .

"this mummy should have stayed under wrapsancient egypt has been a source of fascination for the western world for centuries . mysteries surrounding the construction and meaning of the pyramids have given rise to numerous theories : some outlandish  others difficult to believe and none proven . most information concerning the arcane secrets of the gigantic structures has been lost to vandals and the ravages of time . were they built using science that we no longer know about ? by ancient astronauts from sirius ? by engineers from legendary atlantis ? or is there a more mundane answer that  for some reason  we've been unable to discover ? recent discoveries that the pyramids might be much older than previously thought  that they are accurate astronomical indicators and that they might not have been built as burial chambers verify how little we know . the lack of facts only adds to the allure of the lost civilization . in the early 1900s  occult groups dressed in egyptian garb . there's even a pyramid with a floating eye on the back of u . s . currency .

"for more reviews and movie screensavers  visit http : //www . joblo . com/i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews  and in both instances  he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon . now  i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development . hmmm . . . . okay . . . now on to my review of chill factor . plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general  to propose a nuclear device to international prospects . when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps  they must keep it cool on ice  and rush it over to an army base  before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit  and kills millions of people . critique : "" speed on an ice-cream truck "" is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers  but unfortunately  the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled  original two hours of cinema  is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film  and the lethal weapon movies  stood for . this film is seasoned in cliches  with plenty of badly written dialogue  over the top acting from cuba gooding jr .  zero chemistry between the two leads  and horribly tacky bad guys  tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe . my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent  because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously "" written ""  that we just had to crack up . that  and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2-  and you guessed it . . . 3 scenario ! and what about all those catchy  hip names to get us to relate to the characters . . . . "" elvis "" and "" nighshift ""  oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes  it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel ) . it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr . got involved in this one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling project . did they actually think that it would boost their careers  or did they know that the script sucked  but discounted any fall from grace  knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ? most probably the latter . have you seen either fled or bulletproof ? well  despite the slight differences in plot  the essentials are basically the same here . you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people  having no choice but to work together to get somewhere  hating each other at first  but over time  learning to respect one another as individuals . yawn . add to that  the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black  drive black cars and black vans  and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head . not too conspicuous  eh ? call me a party-pooper  but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy  this film just doesn't even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining . one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside  and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island  do not a fun  buddy-action flick make .

"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman  _double_team_  and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick  stylish  and somewhat diverting action timekiller . tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels  _knock_off_  but this time around  style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous  and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison  but it makes about as much sense  which is little . van damme plays marcus ray  a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls  electronic equipment  and  yes  jeans . it's all part of some type of ransom scheme  but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world  bombs detonating  and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs  mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme  _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort  1996's _the_quest_ ) . a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "" and "" entrepreneurship  babycakes ! "" standing out among my favorites . but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs . van damme is true to laughable form  perhaps even worse than usual . early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner )  and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon  playing an investigator for the jeans company  spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . in rochon's defense  though  her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs  exquisite bone structure  and perky bosoms  the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_  juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . here  though  tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill  coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . for each nifty trick tsui pulls off  such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices  there are others that are completely superfluous . this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . for instance  one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . as he puts his hand in  the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . it's undoubtedly an interesting visual  but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences  but surprisingly  those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . tsui does what he can to make something of them  employing freeze frames  blurred motion  and unconventional camera angles  but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_  let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) . if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success  he would do best to break free from van damme . . . before it's too late . if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_  the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . that is  if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco .

"the word `unfilmable' is often bandied about over cult classic books . that never stops people from filming them . witness the english patient  which turned out to be filmable after all . and then there was fear and loathing in las vegas  which wasn't . but maybe unfilmable is the wrong word . breakfast of champions might have proved filmable  but it sure isn't watchable . this  of course  saddens me greatly . kurt vonnegut is my favorite author ever  and breakfast of champions was his first book that i read . it made enough of an impression for me to track down his entire oeuvre  which i have devoured . this film just shouldn't have been made  sadly . take cat's cradle ( his second-best work ) next time  that ought to make a great film . why is this breakfast so bad ? because the book is about craziness . dwayne hoover ( willis ) is a crazy auto salesman  married to a crazy wife ( hershey )  and he becomes obsessed with a crazy sci-fi writer named kilgore trout ( finney ) . trout's sales manager ( nolte ) is also a crazy guy that likes to dress in women's lingerie  and his secretary ( headley ) isn't all together . oh  and trout's son ( haas ) wants to be a lounge singer named bunny . what made the book so good is that you can go inside these characters  heads  plus vonnegut's writing style is so nutty that it all actually works . director rudolph tries to do this  too  with wacky camera angles  digital effects  and other tricks  but none of this works . in fact  it's just annoying and is barely entertaining for even a minute . a couple of wisecracks aside  this breakfast is unedible .

"directed by griffin dunne . cast : sandra bullock  nicole kidman  stockard channing  dianne wiest  aidan quinn  goran visjnic  chloe webb  lucinda jenney . 1998 - 105 minutes . rated pg-13 ( for mild violence  profanity  and sexual situations ) . reviewed october 17  1998 . "" practical magic  "" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens  two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches  spanning back 200 years . at the start  their parents die when they are still children  and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . switch to the present day  gillian  who is the stronger  more rebellious sibling  leaves home  and meets up with a dark  abusive guy ( goran visjnic )  while sally stays in their hometown  meets and falls in love with a sweet  caring man  has two children  and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it  she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic  they accidentally murder him  and in desperation  bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house . add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism  not to mention a spattering of "" light-hearted whimsy  "" and you have a pretty good idea how messy "" practical magic "" is . after seeing the film  i reflected that there was not even one scene  or element  that i liked or enjoyed . it is a comedy  to be sure  but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat  and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . it is not charming or entertaining in any way . and then to top it off  we've got this dark  but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body . whatever . the characters are handled terribly  and actually  most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film  and in every scene involving them  they are always standing side-by-side . no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . the same goes for aidan quinn  as a handsome police investigator  who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock  even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark  and once again  there is no attempt to develop their relationship  or his character  in any way . in fact  every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along  rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits  when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman  who managed to destroy the "" batman "" series with "" batman forever "" and "" batman and robin . "" "" practical magic "" is directed by griffin dunne  primarily an actor  who last year made the contrived  clumsy romance  "" addicted to love  "" with meg ryan and matthew broderick . i disliked that movie quite a bit  but since "" practical magic "" is even worse  that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead  but in these last two years  he's ultimately already buried himself . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman http : //hometown . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html

"rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odeon ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by redbus on june 2  2000 ; certificate 15 ; 104 minutes ; country of origin uk ; aspect ratio 1 . 85 : 1 directed by ben elton ; produced by phil mcintyre . written by ben elton ; based on his novel "" inconceivable "" . photographed by roger lanser ; edited by peter hollywood . to see ben elton's "" maybe baby "" is to suffer one of the most embarrassing of things -- a comedian straining to be funny . successful humour comes out naturally and clearly ; it doesn't need to be underlined  shouted or propped up by outlandish gags . there is a scene in this movie where a guy is being read the results of a sperm test  which tell him that a percentage of his little tadpoles are sluggish . "" sluggish ? ! "" he cries . "" couldn't they have figured out a better way of putting it  like 'relaxed' ? relaxed sperm ! "" when he's told that some are swimming in the wrong direction : "" hello ? ! they're in a plastic cup ! ! "" these same lines could be funny  if the guy was desperately muttering them to himself  as rambling thoughts . i can picture woody allen playing it like that . but hugh laurie  the actor onscreen  shouts and makes expressive gestures  as if playing to a sitcom laughter track . a lot of "" maybe baby "" is like that -- although on the surface the problem seems to be a cheesy screenplay  it's actually the delivery that's off . i kept imagining what the dialogue would sound like if spoken more calmly  and much of it would be witty  warm and funny . that is not a defence of writer-director elton  but simply an observation . comedy is a fifty-fifty balancing act of writing and performing  so to screw up even one of these is no small matter . the story involves a thirtysomething married couple -- happy  well-off  but desperately in want of a child . sam ( laurie ) and lucy ( joely richardson ) make love morning and night  in time slots carefully planned around lucy's menstrual cycle  but months go by without any sign of pregnancy . so they begin to try in vitro fertilisation treatment ; a long  frustrating process that alternately tests their wits and brings them closer together  what with its great need for patience and emotional commitment . it would be fascinating to see a real movie about the subject of ivf . "" maybe baby "" is not it . we don't get answers to our obvious curiosities  such as whether or not sam and lucy get a kid  or how they react to that success or failure . instead  the plot veers off into sam writing a screenplay about his marriage  producing it in secret  and then having to heal lucy's anger when she finds out . even when elton is concentrating on the ivf storyline  he seems more interested in the goofy side-characters it gives him a chance to introduce . among them are a loudmouth scottish film director ( tom hollander )  a burlesque australian nurse ( dawn french )  and an insane gynaecologist who sadistically dangles his instruments ( rowan atkinson ) . none of these people are believable  and since this isn't a slapstick comedy  that means they're not funny . as i've said  anything perceptive that might have existed in the dialogue is ruined by the over-the-top delivery  so ultimately we're left with nothing interesting but a couple of sexy shots of joely richardson . elton based "" maybe baby "" on his novel "" inconceivable ""  which he has said was inspired in concept but not content on his own ivf experiences . his reason for not making it more autobiographical was that he felt it would be more personally comfortable to invent contrived humour for the story than use the truth . that's exactly the opposite of how comedians are supposed to work . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit  and encourage others to visit  the uk critic's website at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic

"actually  i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . "" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen . at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage . and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless  hate to burst your bubble  but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire . you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake  but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude  it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not . a nipple hallucination sort of thing . barb wire was adapted from a comic book  interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life  even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions . yes  like the mona lisa  pamela anderson is a man-made beauty  probably in more senses than one . she is a definite beauty  though  and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience . you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie  because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills . i mean  she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention . the movie is set in the year 2017  "" the worst year of my life  "" pam says . ( "" the worst movie of the year  "" i say . ) america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley  i think ) . she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right  posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute . but don't call her "" babe . "" she hates that  and reminds us of that fact way too many times . imagine  a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist  demeaning term . a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like "" babe "" during a strip tease  especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success . the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners . in the words of one of the characters  they're "" more than meets the eye . "" reminds me of the "" transformers "" cartoon  and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent  but that never happened . no  the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme  big-busted kickboxer  and her resistance accomplices  ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) . thank god they didn't name her cora reef . one bad character name is more than enough . pamela originally doesn't take sides  giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her  but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother  jack noseworthy of bon jovi "" always "" video fame . i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy  but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy ) . pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest . it's not rambo . . . it's bimbo ! mark my words  barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year . it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin  the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free . it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism  laughable flashbacks  bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo . there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen . someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars . if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years  you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements . barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over  car crashes  explosions  broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death . this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct . barb wire has only two things going for it . . . and i think you know what those two things are .

( there'll be no rome left for him . ) before maximus is ordained  commodus kills his father and thus becomes a tyrant king . he orders the deaths of maximus and family  then sits back in the throne . maximus narrowly escapes  but is captured ( as a slave ) by a circus leader who runs a traveling gladiator show . coincidentally  commodus decides to reinstate the game in rome  thus the mighty maximus arrives back in the capital harboring a festering vendetta . it's a great story  celebrated warrior turned slave  turned gladiator  turned revolutionist . and crowe is steadfast . but here are the problems : his son and daughter look like models in an aspirin commercial . they have no lines . they're displayed either as utopian or crispy dead - never real . so we feel nothing for them and when they're slain  we don't care . better to leave them unshown . crowe is a great actor  let his love for them be enough to make us care . this is a long film  cut out their segments entirely . conveying them only as ideas  the film would be stronger . i have great faith in crowe's ability to make us long for that family with him . unspecified  we can fill in the blanks with our own warm feelings of home . the two other problems involve the beginning and the ending . i just don't believe that a great wise leader would have so immaturely handled such a delicate situation as depriving the thrown from his immoral son . caesar would have ordered his son commodus off on some important mission in some distant land or other  while maximus was ordained . either that  or ( dare you scheme with me ) caesar may have wanted the son to murder him  thus inspiring maximus all the more - but if the writers intended this twist they certainly did not clearly lay it out . such a strategy would have improved the film and my ability to "" buy in "" earlier on . but weather you "" buy in "" or not  it's still a fun story . powerful underdog  rising from the slime and under-appreciated to challenge the all mighty czar . and there's all that blood and guts in the arena . the very first fight ( meant to establish crowe as a fighting man's general of war ) begins with nightsky-scraping flaming arrows that dash across in the twilight emitting a magically-lethal orange glow . i thought to myself  "" this is one medieval battlefield rumble to end all cinema recreations . "" as the conflict rages  the camera angles become increasingly narrowed and the screen full of flames and blurred soldiers in slow mo . but the effect becomes over-digitized in a strobe reminiscent of a consumer camera  subtracting from the realism and gravity of the fight . and instead of continuing the ever-tightening angle to personalize the savagery  a few mid-wide shots are tossed in . it breaks up the direction of the sequence and wakes the viewer from its hypnotic effect . still a strong sequence overall  but "" the messenger "" did a better job . lastly  this is an action film and not-disappointingly it ends with action . unfortunately  a few additional lines of dialogue are tacked on  again diluting the power of the event . nothing needed to be said !

"original sin ( 2001 ) antonio banderas  angelina jolie  thomas jane  jack thompson  gregory itzin  allison mackie  john pringle  cordelia richards  james haven  pedro armendariz jr . written and directed by michael cristofer  based on the novel "" waltz into darkness "" by cornell woolrich . 112 minutes . rated r   review by ed johnson-ott  nuvo newsweekly www . nuvo . net archive reviews at http : //reviews . imdb . com/reviewsby ? edward + johnson-ott to receive reviews by e-mail at no charge  send subscription requests to ejohnsonott@prodigy . net or e-mail ejohnsonott-subscribe@onelist . com with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line . for "" original sin  "" the road to the screen has been rocky . initially slated for release last november  the film was bumped twice  finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics  generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . so is "" original sin "" really all that bad ? yes it is  but the melodrama does offer some rewards . the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the "" t "" and antonio banderas the "" a "" ) . more importantly  the movie is entertainingly bad . veteran readers know that  as a rule  i don't encourage people to patronize lousy films . most of the time  there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides  the "" let's go laugh at the failings of others "" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . but things are different this summer . quality films  to put it mildly  have been few and far between  so as far as i'm concerned  it's fair to find our kicks where we may . "" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls  "" "" road house "" and "" showgirls "" in the bad movie hall of fame  but it'll do until something worse comes along . the film  adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel  "" waltz into darkness "" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film  "" mississippi mermaid "" )  opens in a turn-of-the-century prison  as jolie's character  slated for a dawn execution  tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like  "" this is not a love story  it is a story about love . "" wary of local gold-diggers  cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america  listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . a practical man  luis chooses a frumpy looking lady  hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . imagine his surprise when his fiancée  julia russell ( jolie )  turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . julia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face . luis then confesses his deception  leading julie to state  with great significance  "" we have something in common  we are both not to trusted . "" after their wedding  luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking  with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun  although the filmmakers' insistence on using one of banderas' legs to cover jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her . luis  the stupidest man who ever lived  immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia  despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . luis must force julia to write to her sister emily  who is frantic over her lack of communication . shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird  it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . finally  when she cleans out his accounts and disappears  luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . incidentally  if you're afraid i'm giving too much away  rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie  leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists  a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . along the way  private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane  who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie "" 61 * "" ) turns up  hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real julia . luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist  having decided that if he can't have her  he will kill her . oh  the pathos of it all . the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story  adjusting their performances accordingly . banderas is suitably impassioned  while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips  she can really pout ) . as for thomas jane  he starts off acting suspicious and cagey  then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . his most startling moment comes when  to prove his power to humiliate  he forces luis against a wall  verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape  show them this chilling scene . and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler  show them "" original sin .

"miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . you see  'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news . no  the mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit  that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer  at least ) franchise . something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber )  the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott  sidney's mother  is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . ( once considered a danger to society  weary now hosts his own talk show  "" 100% cotton ""  a clever  if dated  jab at american pop culture . ) of course  a new ghostface dials him up  and  with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind  we immediately wonder  where is the killer ? the backseat ? the next car ? thrilling prospects  to be sure  but actually  ghostface is at the weary residence  waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . what's missing from this sequence  and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly  the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes  one of which might spring to life )  is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . our other surviving regulars have become estranged . sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks  while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie  "" stab 3 ""  and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . murder reunites them  as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 ""  imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death . the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend  your classmate  your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery  with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next  but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . ironic self-reflection aside  parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . with scream 3  the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some  but the character remains conceptually potent . conceptually . the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky  because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying "" all bets are off ! "" in reference to the "" rules "" of a trilogy's third act  but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating . with the departure of kevin williamson  who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that  for reasons incomprehensible to me  was ignored  save the notion of "" stab 3 "" )  kruger needed to be reined in tighter  and by wes craven . craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies )  akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . it pains me to write this  but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless  with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart )  jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 )  and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . the visuals are much weaker in part three  as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . ( aside : in the wake of columbine  craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony  when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) finally  marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent . sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here  they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe  the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels  scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish  and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : part three must disappoint' .

"capsule : potentially interesting story rendered dull and coldly distant by david lynch's perpetually smug and alienating style . there are better ways to be conned . watching lost highway  i kept thinking about a picture puzzle that you spend a week trying to solve  only to discover half the pieces are missing . i felt conned ; i'd lost two and a half hours of my life over a movie that added up to exactly nothing . everything in lost highway cancels itself out . there are people who have argued this point with me at length  insisting that was what the movie was about . i disagree  because lost highway doesn't even bother to enlist our attention long enough to be about anything . it is a self-important and boring film that builds in its own excuses for being and never tells us what they are . the story actually has an intriguing presence . a jazz musician ( bill pullman ) and his wife receive a series of videotapes in the mail . someone is walking around filming their house . then the stranger gets bolder and starts filming the * inside * of the house as well . eventually  the tapes show pullman having murdered his wife -- and sure enough  guess what's happened . pullman is sent to prison  but while awaiting execution  he has a series of bizarre lynchian experiences in his cell and morphs into someone else ( balthazar getty )  a young punk . nobody can explain it  but they have to let him go . that doesn't mean they can't keep an eye on him  of course . as i said  all of this is potentially interesting . not in lynch's hands . everything i described is stretched out to fill the entire first hour of the movie  which slithers by * so * slowly and lingers on every insignificant gesture * so * painfully that by the time we get to the change-over  all interest in the goings-on has been buried . the actors are not bad in their roles -- they're just made into zombies . i was reminded of the way robert bresson -- the french director with an almost paranoid loathing of actors attempting to supersede the director's vision -- who made his actors repeat scenes until they simply did them with mechanical precision and no attempt at personification . except that bresson had a larger vision to communicate . lynch has nothing that we can discern  save the urge to be artfully bizarre . the other day i saw begotten  a movie with no dialogue and no real storyline that succeeded excellently in being enthralling . why did that work and lost highway fail ? probably because begotten was purer and not beholden to anything remotely familiar . lost highway is so obviously david lynch indulging himself to no good end that we're alienated and fed up in short order . david lynch has made two  possibly three films that i enjoyed : eraserhead  which was probably the best showcase for his homegrown surreal nightmares ; blue velvet  which actually set up a story in the midst of his pretentions  and the elephant man  which made the most sense and was the most human . everything since  and no doubt from now on  has proven to be a waste of time  and to be honest i'm not one to mourn .

"ok  i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . yes  the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual "" identities  "" they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of "" girl power . "" but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut  a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . the film begins amusingly enough  with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- "" scary "" ( melanie brown )  "" baby "" ( emma bunton )  "" sporty "" ( melanie chisolm )  "" ginger "" ( geri halliwell )  and "" posh "" ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to  much to my surprise  excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad "" too much "" ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls' manager  clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant "" mate "" ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) . capped off by a live rendition of the girls' bouncy hit "" say you'll be there  "" a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow  right ? wrong . it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves  but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them  much less a organized framework for all the "" wacky "" goings-on . spice world jumps from vignette to vignette  subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense  at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a "" dance bootcamp "" scene  the girls sing the lyric "" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra "" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . some gags are just plain pointless  such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief  who dispenses cryptic  metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . ha ha . as weak as the script is  i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie  and that is the girls themselves . the point is not that they can't act ( and  for the record  they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas  which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video  are too thin to survive outside of the truncated  video bite mtv world . posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . baby's persona ( young innocent )  to a lesser extent  also works  but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out . there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do )  and  after all  what exactly entails being "" ginger "" or "" scary "" ? apparently  just their wardrobes . spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit  "" wannabe . "" the song is as grating as ever  but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm  setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . this section of the film  involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus  is perhaps its most effective  but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher  the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family  and it will please the spice faithful . but this sloppy enterprise surely won't win them any new fans  which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . once the hype disappears  spice world will likely serve as the the spices' final hurrah in america .

'nuff said . neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes  presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay  we get it brian  this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my ears hurt ! ) . so is anything salvageable in this movie ? sure . gary sinise does another great job  as does cheadle  the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening  and yes  the "" sand-twister "" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . other than that ? i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops  did i say "" admire ""  i meant "" am disgusted "" ! all in all  this movie delivers very little in actual substance  offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo  pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy  and eventually just settles into an ending which  other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story  gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . go see the ninth gate . . . now there's a great movie ! and on a personal note  i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences  and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting .

"an attempt at florida film noir  palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels . it's slow moving  uninvolving  and plain just uninteresting . harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man  just out of jail after being framed for a crime . his luck hasn't been the best  but things are looking up when a mysterious woman  rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue )  approaches him with a proposition . she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter  odette ( chloe sevigny )  pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500  000 out of her stingy  but rich  husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) . at first  all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone  and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . but  as the deed is carried out  things are not what they seem  and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm . palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film  but the effect never quite comes together . it's got the sultry florida heat  seductive women  and even curvier plot twists  but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . sure  the right ingredients are there  but the end result is much too artificial . a lot of the problems lie with the script  which  though providing some genuine surprises  is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations . even the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story . some of them  for example  come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer  or the whole typewriter situation ) . the characters are mostly lifeless  played to type  but not much more . woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist . elisabeth shue vamps it up  but doesn't add anything special to the role . chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance  trying to be a sexy 17-year old  but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth . some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger  but  in the end  meaningless performances . and to top it off  the pacing of the film is much too slow . as the movie grinds to a halt  you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it watching palmetto . if you're in the mood for this type of movie  you'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .

"rated : r for strong violence  language  drug use  nudity  and some sexuality . starring : wesley snipes  anne archer  michael chaykin  donald sutherland  marie matiko . i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career . he has his ups and downs  but mostly the downs . his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled "" blade "" . he has had his typical action movies  "" boiling point ""  "" passenger 57 ""  but his new movie "" the art of war "" should just be called "" rising sun 2 : the art of war "" cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot  with a different cast  and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller  that is high on style and low on substance . wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed  he is on the track of the killer  trying to find out who it is  how it happened  where the killer was  and what to do . anne archer plays his "" boss "" type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer  and is now an outlaw  kidnapping a chinese woman with him  and having her help him along the way . all this leads to a finale that is so dumb  and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb  and the stunts  dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's "" blade "" . i walked into "" the art of war "" expecting a good  high octane thriller  and all i got was a pile of mush . the only real 'good' thing the movie has is action  and plenty of it  but i noticed it is badly filmed  the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful  that it even tries to mock "" the matrix ""  laughably funny  it is undeniably stupid . christian duguay's direction is also not that great . his camera angles and sense of style are all in place  but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . even the whole "" matrix "" ending wasn't even good . the stunts and action are badly filmed  and badly choreographed . his placing of the characters  and the assination of the chinese ambassador  and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable  that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . anne archer who is usually good in her roles  turns in a horrible job here . she is sour  downbeat  and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue  and dumb moves . even donald sutherland as a co-star can't save this movie from being a bust . so for an overall opinion : "" the art of war "" is a total waste of time . it's not entertaining  nor exciting  or even action packed . it is a pointless movie  and makes absolutely no sense at all . if you really want to see a good version of "" the art of war ""  rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind "" rising sun ""  it isn't a great film either  but at least it's better than this .

"it's not a bad thing to update old stories . it's done all the time in the oral tradition . the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed  it's that it's dry . the new cinderella  danielle ( drew barrymore ) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come . she's a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france . when her father dies  she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) . she works by day  but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night . although the story is updated  you know the plot . danielle meets prince henry ( dougray scott )  goes to a ball disguised  is later found out and they live happily ever after . the movie is often like watching a filmed play . theater in real life is engrossing . theater on the screen is usually lifeless . there doesn't seem to be much going on . the camera can be a star of films . here it's a co-conspirator . danielle's convictions are compromised . a socialist and a feminist  she pretends to be royalty to get her man . a kind woman  her last act in the movie is one of revenge . the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish . the fairy godmother stand-in  leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle . huston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness . in all fairness  my companion loved the film . maybe it's one of those "" chick flicks "" that men don't like . it is certainly a date film . nearly the entire audience was couples . oh well  maybe it's good for something .

""" tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! "" a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981  paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance . indeed  in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two  three  even six times . no  the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events  some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! "" . executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn  but it was all too late . mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . unfortunately  faye dunaway's energetic  at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature . based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography  mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . if you believe this movie  it was a life was racked by obsession  lonliness  child abuse and rampant egomania . the film begins with crawford adopting two children  and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will . joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves  you see . but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end . the script - laboured over by four writers  a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . frank perry's direction is no more than competent  and dunaway's bitchy lines aside  the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . in fairness  the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling  joan visits and keeps in touch  not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions . crawford does seem to care about her daughter  but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . ah  but there is dunaway's performance . and what a delicious piece of campery it often is . having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds  crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making . spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of  she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line "" tina ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! "" with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling . in the film's most outrageous scene  joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers . oh dear ! sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum  doesn't it ? this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : "" no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! "" . and later  when the board of her late husband's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship  she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : "" don't fuck with me  fellas ! ! "" . oh joy ! something of a camp classic  then  but if that's not you're cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn't have too much to recommend it . better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 )  mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) . great films distinguished by great performances  and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth .

"serial killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) is murdering young women by placing them in a sealed glass room for forty hours and then flooding the room till they drown . fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) has finally tracked the killer down  but stargher has fallen into a coma from which he will never awaken . this wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that he kidnapped one last girl who is in that very room  and she's running out of time . novak has no idea where the room is  so he employs the services of dr . catherine deane ( jennifer lopez )  a child psychologist  who can use a technology to enter peoples' minds . it seems catherine is able to make her patients trust her better than any psychologist who has tried the machine before . novak hopes stargher will trust her and tell her the location . she agrees to enter stargher's mind  but she's never experienced anything like stargher's mind before . soon she's lost in the disturbing world of stargher's sub-conscious  unable to tell she's no longer in the real world . so novak decides to go in and fetch her  but stargher's mind is ready for him . stephen king once said  regarding stanley kubrick's adaption of "" the shining ""  "" i think you want to hurt people with this movie . "" i disagree with his assessment of kubrick's horror masterpiece ( in my humble opinion anyway )  but i think his words can be accurately applied to tarsem singh's travesty  "" the cell "" . there's nothing remotely likeable about this film . the only thing i could think of that i somewhat enjoyed were a few special effects sequences . other than that  i was experiencing only three different emotions : bored  confused  and outraged . it's also the only movie this year that i've almost walked out of . is it worse than "" battlefield earth "" ? of course not  but at least that piece of tripe was so bad i could laugh at it . "" the cell "" is one of the most pretentious  stuck up movies i've ever seen ( it even beat out "" magnolia "" )  completely convinced of how important its message is . it's one thing for a movie to feature a controversial message  it's quite another for the writers to cram that message down your throat . singh and protosevich do just that in "" the cell ""  and i hope never to see another film from either of them . so how does the acting fare in this horrendous movie ? well  you've got vincent d'onofrio ( "" 13th floor "" ) playing a serial killer ; something he seems to enjoy very much  but he sleepwalks his way through the role . i heard him in a recent interview discussing the types of roles he now takes  and he stated "" i take only the roles which interest me . "" if that's the case  and this role interested him  i think mr . d'onofrio might be in need of serious medical attention . jennifer lopez ( who was wonderful in last year's "" out of sight "" ) seems to be convinced  throughout the film  that speaking softly all the time is the same thing as acting concerned . the only problem is i couldn't hear half the "" concerned "" things she was saying . vince vaughn ( "" swingers ""  the horrible "" psycho "" remake ) isn't given much of a chance to act since his character is so underdeveloped . protosevich's idea of developing the character seems to be for him to say that he doesn't agree with killers blaming their crimes on their childhood . when lopez's character argues with him about this however  he doesn't really fight back . watch for a cameo by james gammon ( "" major league "" ) as a local police officer . in that first paragraph i mentioned a message being crammed down our throats  and that message is basically all there is to "" the cell "" . singh tries to hide it behind bizarre visuals and overly dramatic dialogue  but all i noticed was the message being shoved in my face . what was this message that i refer to with such bitterness ? simply  that inside every psychopathic serial killer there's a scared little person trying to get out . what a serial killer does is really just a cry for help so people will listen to him  since his parents were abusive when he was a child . i figure there will be three different groups of people seeing this movie : first will be the group to which i belong - outraged that this message was being thrown at us ; second is the group that agrees with the message and thinks it's wonderful that it's being shown in a movie ; and last is the luckiest group  those who either don't notice or don't care about the message and just sit there dazzled by the pretty colors on screen . if you're in the first group  i urge you to stay away from this movie . if you're in the second group  i adamantly disagree with you . if you're in the third group  i envy you . obviously  one of the biggest draws of "" the cell "" is the shocking visuals  and i'll admit  they look nice in about a scene and a half . other than that  they generally resemble poor attempts to imitate clive barker . it's as though the film makers were thinking "" let's see what bizarre/disgusting image we can hurl at them next ""  without using images that went along with the story . tarsem singh's filming style involves giving all the dream sequences a washed out look for no other reason than to distinguish between dreams and real life ( as though the floating people and pools of blood weren't tipping us off ) . it also involves making everything from the dialogue ( except jennifer lopez's ) to the music ( an obnoxious score by howard shore ) to the sound effects gratingly loud and in-your-face . tarsem singh is a first time director  and i can only hope he'll never be handed another project . "" the cell "" runs a long 105 minutes . i'd recommend it only to psychology majors who want to either argue or agree with the film's message and to aspiring directors so they can see how not to present strange visuals . i give the movie one and a half out of five stars . comments ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . netpast reviews can be found at : http : //www . epinions . com/user-elerad ? public=yes or http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? john + beachem * * * * * - one of the best movies of the year . * * * * - great flick  try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie  hits and misses . * * - pretty bad  see it at your own risk . * - see this one only if you enjoy pain . get your private  free e-mail from msn hotmail at http : //www . hotmail . com .  share information about yourself  create your own public profile at http : //profiles . msn . com .

"this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company . based in central london  this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . when he seems unwilling  she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes  such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador . her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages . she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead . meanwhile  theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her . however  she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire ! this film is the second worst carry on movie  the worst being 'carry on england' . it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written . newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny  but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad . kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted  given the script . the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler  joan sims as mrs . dangle  kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur  and peter butterworth as richmond  are worthless and embarassing . in fact  all four parts are surplus to requirements . however  the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades . an awful script  a terrible collection of jokes  very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace )  a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score  and a non-existent plot or storyline . its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next ! jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring  joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted  and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile . a complete waste of time  this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies . it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978  there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 ! avoid at all costs !

"these days  people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off  and now  people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . few years in the future  early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . however  i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1  that  in many ways  symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series  this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez )  burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge  and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson )  by-the-book policeman  days away from retirement . two of them  following the murder of luger's ex- partner  must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner )  crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . the authors of this films ( whose director  gene quintano  worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects  and that reflects in the lack plot  characters  and  even original lines . the plot  or what goes for the plot in this movie  is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series  this film "" borrows "" its female lead from basic instinct ) . the best gags  are  same as with many other similar movies  shown in the trailers . the rest simply doesn't work . only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . others would probably wince at the lameness of humour . some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . but  at the end  spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort .

"directed by david twohy . screenplay by jim wheat  ken wheat and twohy . starring vin diesel  radha mitchell  cole hauser . running time : 108 minutes . rated aa for offensive language and violent scenes . reviewed on march 16th  2000 . my first exposure to "" pitch black "" came when the preview was played in front of "" girl  interrupted "" a month and a half ago . the preview hinted at monsters which lived on a sun-drenched planet but could only come out in the darkness . then : "" an eclipse ! "" how convenient  i thought ; i could see the whole movie playing out in my mind . i held out some hope that the filmmakers might surprise me  but sadly  actually watching "" pitch black "" did not prove to be a revelatory experience . "" pitch black "" is indeed as improbable  formulaic and predictable as its preview implies . the film is set sometime in the future . men travel the stars in enormous ships  cryogenically frozen for the duration of the voyage . one such spaceship is knocked off course and crashlands  killing all but a handful of the passengers and crew . the survivors include docking pilot caroline fry ( radha mitchell )  uneasy with authority and plagued by self-doubts ; no-nonsense mercenary william johns ( cole hauser ) ; and richard riddick ( vin diesel )  a convicted murderer . the planet on which they are marooned has three suns  and as a result is a dry  blasted terrain without plants or water . soon  though  the survivors discover evidence of a previous human expedition to the planet which appears to have been violently wiped out . the culprits soon become obvious : in underground caverns live hideous creatures which thrive in darkness and emerge onto the planet's surface only during a total solar eclipse  which in a feat of mathematical and physical improbability occurs like clockwork every twenty-two years . of course  the cycle is almost up and soon the survivors find themselves under assault from wave upon wave of the terrifying  merciless monsters which are almost invisible in the pervasive darkness . their only hope lies with the enigmatic riddick  whose eyes have been surgically altered to permit him to see in the dark . convenient indeed . but to be fair  films have to be permitted a certain degree of latitude when it comes to such coincidences ; without them  in many cases there just wouldn't be much of a movie . this is particularly true of science-fiction movies  which are so totally dependent on the imagined and the improbable to begin with . but such a leap of faith would be far easier to make if it were in the service of an entertaining movie . "" pitch black "" simply is not . the entire movie is little more than one long  drawn-out chase scene . the characters have to get from point a to point b while avoiding the monsters  and there isn't much more to "" pitch black "" than that . the movie is punctuated only by a few token nods to character development  as well as the obligatory deaths which occur with almost comical timing . it is so easy to forecast right from the start the identity of those characters who survive to the end  it's criminal . this is a classic example of writing by the numbers ; the screenplay by jim wheat  ken wheat and director david twohy could just as easily have been generated by a computer program  it is so routine . the best aspect of "" pitch black "" is the computer-animated special effects . there are some beautiful shots of the spaceship cruising past the rings of a saturn-like planet  and of the onset of the solar eclipse . the monsters are also well-designed  although they do seem to owe something to "" alien "" . twohy at least has the presence of mind to keep the monsters mostly out of sight for much of the film  adding to their sense of menace . even when they are fully unveiled  the lighting and camerawork keeps them indistinct . it's a shame  then  that "" pitch black "" utilizes them in such tired  unimaginative situations . they hammer against doors . they follow the party just out of sight in the darkness . they pop out of nowhere in an apparently empty corridor . there aren't many genuine frights here  and even the rare creepy moments are obvious and predictable . part of the movie's problem is that it develops few sympathetic characters to generate viewer interest . i found it difficult to be absorbed into the atmosphere of terror "" pitch black "" attempts to generate when i had absolutely no emotional investment in the characters whatsoever . i think it says something about the movie that of the three principals  the most sympathetic is the mass murderer  riddick . sort of a hunky hannibal lecter with super-powers  diesel does a good job of making riddick an intriguing anti-hero while not forgetting that he is  after all  still a criminal . mitchell and hauser  meanwhile  struggle futilely with their unmemorable  unlikeable characters . the rest of the ragtag band is largely forgettable  although keith david does what he can with the underdeveloped role of the spiritual imam . "" pitch black "" is a dismal and tedious exercise in moviemaking  failing even to provide the requisite thrills and chills  let alone living up to the enormous potential of the science-fiction genre . sci-f provides filmmakers with the opportunity to exercise the entire breadth of their vision and creativity  to do things no other genre permits . it is all the more unfortunate  then  to see a movie like "" pitch black "" dismiss this opportunity in favor of the banal and the ordinary . while the characters spend the entire movie running around the deathtrap planet  the audience is well advised to run in only one direction : away from the theater . either that  or go into cryogenic sleep until "" pitch black "" is over . copyright © 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/pitchblack . html

"director : carl schenkel || screenplay : bayard johnson and j . anderson black || stars : casper van dien ( tarzan )  jane march ( jane porter )  steven waddington ( nigel ravens ) || mpaa rating : pg "" tarzan and the lost city "" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . not only it is poorly written  badly acted  and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas  it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . unfortunately  it's not bad in the way great  colossal misfires like "" heaven's gate "" ( 1980 ) or "" ishtar "" ( 1987 ) were bad . instead  it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with  which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced  how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? of course  tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films  which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan  lord of the apes "" ) down to the really bad ( 1981's "" tarzan  the ape man "" with bo derek ) . most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties  starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . therefore  if another tarzan movie is to be made  one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle  an original storyline  anything to set it apart from all the others . "" greystoke "" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale  and even "" tarzan  the ape man "" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts . "" tarzan and the lost city  "" on the other hand  has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . the script  by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . comic books have better plots than this . the movie is so bad  in fact  that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy "" george of the jungle . "" didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes  and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . when the movie starts in 1913  he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent )  and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . however  when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar  one of africa's last great secrets  the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . at first  jane refuses to go  pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down  therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way )  it delves into a series of jungle adventures  as tarzan  jane  and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . most of the so-called adventures are cheesy  predictable  and unexciting  with no pace  tension  or action to speak of . there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies  ranging from "" raiders of the lost ark "" ( 1981 ) to "" the goonies "" ( 1985 ) . when the movie is running short on action  it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals  releasing a baby elephant from a trap  and throwing ivory tusks into the river . the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . for instance  when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra  he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . instead  he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . of course  one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . not to ruin the ending or anything  but there is no lost city . there is  however  a lost pyramid  which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid  when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? strictly speaking  "" tarzan and the lost city "" isn't even bad enough to have camp quality  although casper van dien's laughably stiff performance comes real close . this movie proves what "" starship troopers "" only hinted at : he cannot act  but he sure looks well-groomed  even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . waddington makes a decent villain  although he's like a charmless version of belloq from "" raiders of the lost ark . "" as jane  the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two  but whenever a snake comes into the picture  she is reduced to a hysterical mess . however  amidst all this complaining  i do have one piece of good news . "" tarzan and the lost city "" is so lacking in ideas both new and old  that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . so  we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short .

"come on hollywood  surprise me . stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue  sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . personal  because his niece is one of the victims . it's a slobbering psychopath  of course  but this time there's a twist . freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed  assertive  and more successful in their careers than the average girl . we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova  whose aim is to "" dominate "" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . anyway  one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well  you know the rest . a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs  with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants  may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story . perhaps  but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue . so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further  okay ? and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh please ! kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . maybe the novel was a stinker to start with  but whatever the case  it's the writing that's clearly at fault here . one  these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting . two  the script has no sense of humour . three  while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart  successful women is an interesting twist  the execution isn't even half as good as the idea . thus  ashly judd comes across all out of focus  instead of being the heart of the story . we can't feel her rage . some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type  but these conversations barely register . and as for freeman  kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction  now this . for an actor of his calibre  this is most worrying . young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead . but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? not much  and you can hardly blame him . there's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls  dives and jumps  and the effect is startling . but the script is beyond rescue . what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe  safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up . complacency rules : it's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters  real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue . the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie  positive proof that the best things in life aren't free . . . . .

"cast : casper van dien  jane march  steven waddingham director : carl schenkel producers : stanley canter  dieter geissler  michael lake screenplay : baynard johnson and j . anderson black based on the "" tarzan "" stories by edgar rice burroughs cinematography : paul gilpin music : christopher franke u . s . distributor : warner brothers this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . tarzan and the lost city  the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen  is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . badly conceived and poorly executed  tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . furthermore  it's even more curious that this film is rated pg  which  by definition  rules out any sex or explicit violence . and  while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story  tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . of course  no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city  since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor  and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences  the film barely registers a pulse . anyone in search of a relatively entertaining  family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book  which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which  unfortunately  includes the two lead actors ) . the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story  the thinking is that it has been done often enough . instead  tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . he is living happily in england  enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . meanwhile  in central africa  the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington )  a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer  believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar  which he calls the cradle of civilization . on the way there  he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things  like burning native villages  to earn the wrath of the locals . one shaman  determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal  sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . with lady jane following close behind  he returns to the jungle where he was born . its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . with his plastic facial expressions  monotone voice  and complete inability to make convincing animal noises  his range rivals that of steven seagal . his pecs  however  are impressive  and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . jane march  on the other hand  has to keep her shirt on  which may be a first for her . some six years ago  march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . since then  she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night  which exploited her every acting defiency . tarzan continues this trend . march may be attractive  but  at least judging by this performance  she can't act . meanwhile  steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . instead  he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . the story line is pure formula  which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . the romantic elements are all contrived  in fact  lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes  apparently  animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . and  of course  as with all jungle movies  there are the obligatory cute animals . over the years  the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller  but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott  who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . and  having seen tarzan and the lost city  i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 .

"_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ ( pg-13 ) 1/2  ) two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit "" what is love ? "" while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit  but _snl_ producer lorne michaels  _clueless_ creator amy heckerling  and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring "" roxbury guys "" sketch that would presumably make a good feature . emphasis on the word "" presumably . "" _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels . the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original "" roxbury guys "" skits . with "" what is love ? "" blaring on the soundtrack  the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads  scope out "" hotties "" at clubs  and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . there is one crucial difference  however--these guys speak . that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence  that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren  ferrell  and kattan are new  that's for sure  but they all lead to comic dead ends . there is no story per se  only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . the brothers literally run into ( or  rather  get run into  as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame  and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . there  they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri  conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? )  who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . meanwhile  the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father  a rift is created between the two . the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny  but virtually none of it is . the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film  with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . alas  the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . granted  a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_  but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration . that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_  "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . after watching one of the "" roxbury "" skits on snl  this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to "" what is love ?

"starring : chris o'donnell  rene zellwegar  artie lange  ed anser  hal holbrook  james cromwell  marley shelton  mariah carey . well there goes another one . sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good . this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite . from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad  and well i guess i was right . with bad excuses for acting  a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend  he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . so he proposes in a really bad way  and she shoots him down and is very mad . he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her  or get married to someone else to get the money itself  leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest  cliched  silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . even the supporting roles of artie lange  hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . the plot was a good idea  but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies  he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming  sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . it's not like this is an original idea and in the end  everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . 'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul  and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie  with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success  and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies  even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . even though some may think of this as a good date movie  most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . besides being a terrible movie  'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . being one of the worst movies of the year  we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies  and if they do they i give up on filmmakers . reviewed by brandon herring  november 13  1999 . brandon herring http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/movie/3160/moviereviewheaven . html

"" who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out ? we never get an answer  just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland . to make a long  boring  stupid  and just plain bad story short ; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen ( tripplehorn ) and enola . they sail for a long time  encountering some strange people in the process and fight off "" the smokers "" as lead by the idiot villain deacon ( hopper )  who kidnaps enola . the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons  rescuing enola  and bringing them all to salvation ( how original ) . even with all its special effects  action  and adventure this film is boring . not a single character is likable  therefore neither is the plot . dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson's joker  while costner just plain rips . still  "" waterworld "" is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it . i just hope they don't make a sequel ! please visit chad'z movie page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 140 new and old films reviewed in depth  not just blind ratings and capsules . also  check out the first shay astar web page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz/shayastar . html

"cast : liam neeson  catherine zeta-jones  owen wilson  lili taylor  bruce dern  virginia madsen  lisa loeb written by : david self directed by : jan de bont running time : 112 minutes date reviewed : august 4  1999 overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson's novel "" the haunting of hill house "" ) stars lili taylor as one of three "" lab rats "" that participate in a supposed "" insomnia "" study being initiated by liam neeson . he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it . he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of "" creepy "" cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience's patience . i know this question has been posed before  but why do people keep remaking good movies ? the original was a great psychological horror film . this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary . in fact  i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary . unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening  then there's nothing in this film that will raise hackles . i nearly fell asleep twice during the film  and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn't seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed . it's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly . owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house  and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's going on as the rest of them do . finally  poor lili taylor  the center of the film  gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her . apparently  a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor's characters was filmed but removed . that's too bad  because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . this is jan de bont's second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything  it would have served to make the film terrifying . what our mind fashions on it's own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . apparently  yet another version of this story is being filmed under it's original title . i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont's version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had .

"director : brian depalma writer : david koepp ( story by brian depalma and david koepp ) starring : nicolas cage  gary sinise  carla gugino  stan shaw  kevin dunn  john heard  joel fabiani  chip zien  david higgins  luis guzmán "" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . it's not just because this is a brian depalma film  and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance  this film is hardly worth his talents . it's worse than that . it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more  could be totally intelligent  and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . or more deservedly  the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . in certain circles  "" snake eyes "" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic "" rashomon  "" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives  and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening  which  i might add  is superb . in one very very very long steadicam shot  we meet the protagonist  crooked atlantic city detective  rick santoro ( cage )  and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife  interupts a pay-per-view event on tv  chases down a gambler  enters the arena all pumped up for the fight  sits down and talks with his bud  kevin dunne ( gary sinise  who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn  who's also in this )  and watches as it happens . there's a big name in the crowd  and that's the secretary of defense  charles kirkland ( joel fabiani )  who's sitting behind rick  and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion  lincoln tyler ( stan shaw )  is knocked out . this all happens in the opening shot  and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . what really happened  this film asks  and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . as we follow rick trying to learn of more information  we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino )  and who flees the scene in a panic  and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened . this is all going pretty fine and dandy  and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . then it takes one wrong step . we follow the wrong character  and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on  and way before rick can find it out . but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring  the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film  and since we already know what happened  we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting . it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in  and decided to just fall back on an easy way out  and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . events become more and more proposterous  and by the end  the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . this time  it's a hurricane  an out-of-control police car  and a big round ball that adorned the arena . what went wrong ? depalma and the screenwriter  david koepp  are extremely credible people in their respective fields  and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . depalma  who idolizes hitchcock to death  has done many a film like this  such as his masterpiece  "" blow out  "" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . but granted  depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch  what with his over-the-top shot set-ups  notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel  forgetting anything about boundaries . at least his direction makes up partly for it . then there's koepp  who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier "" carlito's way  "" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . he can write a flawed character  but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . he's flawed  and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic . a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity  because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption  then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . as i was watching the first half hour  i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed  how many different perspectives he'd be given  and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe . now there's a film . unfortunately  the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other  about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before  but never from someone like depalma .

"" flubber  "" as you probably know  is a remake of the disney classic i never saw  "" the absent minded professor  "" where a  well  absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as "" flubber  "" you know  flying rubber ? the new one keeps the basic plot  but appears to have added a lot else  like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor  some more villains  and several "" show-stopping "" moments  like a big rumba with the flubber  and some more elaborate setups  none which really make it any better  but instead make it worse . the basic plot revolves around a college professor  philip brainerd ( robin williams )  who creates lots and lots of inventions  but is sadly absent minded . in fact  he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president  sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden )  two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? anyway  on his wedding day ( the third one )  he invents the flubber  which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed  but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in "" the abyss . "" philip believes that this invention  once fully realized  will save his college  which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain  chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry )  which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . through a plot twist  hoenicker's goons  named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check )  discover it the hard way  and try to steal for hoenicker  who wants it just 'cause he's evil enough . a sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara  who's angry at him ( and with good reason )  but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq  wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald  playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . and in another subplot  philip's day-timer robot  weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson )  falls in love with him . yuckity-yuck . what's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . you don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film  which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney  who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry  half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public  who sadly eats it all up . earlier in '97  they released "" jungle 2 jungle  "" an adaptation of a really awful french film  "" un indien dans la ville  "" which  yeah  improved over the original  but not by much . disney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now  only creatively . in the rush to ship out a film for distribution  disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called "" magic . "" such scenes as dancing flubber  a flying car  a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber  and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze  delight  or even cause people to laugh . i sat there the entire film stone faced  chuckling perhaps twice  and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? didn't think so . it doesn't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . philip is not a lovable absent minded professory  just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay  a brilliant actor in general  but here he's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something  and other times act sad . those times  he's not bad . but what are we supposed to think of a man who's forgotten his wedding thrice ? maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . . i like disney  and i usually enjoy their films  not only animated but live action  and their recent films ( save for "" hercules  "" which was good  but not great ) have been worse than lackluster  they've been pathetic . "" jungle 2 jungle "" is probably the worst film i saw last year . "" flubber "" 's probably second . what do they need to do ? perhaps create something new . get writers who can write something that's universally entertaining . films like "" the parent trap "" and "" mary poppins "" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both )  but even i can still watch them because they're not only written to be magical to children  but to be fun to adults . what's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? and my god  couldn't they have done something else with edie mcclurg ?

"cast : leonardo dicaprio  tilda swinton  virginie ledoyen  guillaume canet  robert carlyle director : danny boyle producer ( s ) : andrew macdonald  callum mcdougall disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life  richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand . there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach  a secret utopia  then commits suicide . richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel  étienne ( guillaume canet ) and françoise ( virginie ledoyen ) . once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach  there richard falls for françoise . this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element  which is solely a creation of hollywood  seems to hold to the original novel . the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking . i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning . but that is were many things go wrong  darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography . though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking . the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts . this is where the movie has some great potential  then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better  yes folks i said better . now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good  nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise . this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable . there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting  it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) . i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing  so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me . the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child . although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher . the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason  granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does . the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough . richard is obviously obsessed by françoise at the early stages of the story  yet there is actually very little development along this story line . this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused . now  i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) . the cast and acting was passable at the very least  and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard . mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better . which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) . but i like the fact that there was an international cast used  had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible . the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable . not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense . when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable . i would not recommend this movie to anyone  the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story . as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt . if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings . february 21  2000 for any comments i can be reached at bootsector@hotmail . com

"director : john boorman || screenplay : john boorman || stars : sean connery ( zed )  charlotte rampling ( consuella )  sara kestelman ( may )  sally anne newton ( avalow )  john alderton ( friend )  niall buggy ( zardoz/arthur frayn )  bosco hogan ( george saden )  jessica swift ( apathetic ) || mpaa rating : r john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . of course  wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . boorman  on the other hand  cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film  the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" ) . boorman obviously had a sizable budget  a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role  and although you wouldn't know it from this film  boorman does indeed have talent . this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 )  as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 )  the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 ) . his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination  but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . if boorman is anything  he's ambitious  and when he succeeds  it's in grand fashion . unfortunately  the bigger they are  the harder they fall  and when boorman falls  the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . "" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies  an obsession of boorman's . his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz  "" a book which figures into the movie's plot . but  despite all this reaching  the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . the events take place in the distant year 2293  but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . in fact  things seems to have moved backwards  with people riding horses  shooting old-style guns  and living in large victorian mansions . it's more middle ages than space age . the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands  where all the poor  pathetic people live  and the vortex  where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . these immortals never grow old  they never engage in sexual activity  they possess psychological powers  and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal  and everyone contributes equally to the society . however  if one breaks the rules  that person is punished by being aged so many years . if someone breaks the rules enough  he or she is aged to the point of senility  and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . one of the immortals  arthur frayn ( niall buggy )  a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face  is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . like "" the wizard of oz  "" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images  and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) calling himself zardoz  frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators  whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources . from inside his giant  stone head  zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like  "" the gun is good . the penis is evil . "" that line alone is worth the movie's cult following . one day  an exterminator named zed ( sean connery )  sneaks into zardoz's flying stone  pushes frayn out  and goes back to the vortex . once there  the immortals label him a "" brutal "" and study him like a lab rat  taking great  perverse care in exploring his sexuality  which is a mystery to them . they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection  and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . i say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is . it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces  although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward  he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper  a mane of hair braided halfway down his back  a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache  and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance  "" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera  including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( "" 2001 "" )  whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in "" zardoz "" besides the inadvertent humor . sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971  and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . he got exactly that in "" zardoz  "" and it's a wonder it didn't end his career . i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? or is it a social statement  something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . come to think of it  maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .

"review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) starring norm macdonald  dave chapelle  elaine stritch  sherman hemsley  daniel benzali  and danny devito the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies  everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends  there is a moment of confusion  then recollection  then some more confusion  then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make movies fun to watch . then there are the bad twists . you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . screwed perfectly suits the latter description . what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . larry flynt  scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . whoops . screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . norm macdonald stars as willard filmore  a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich  old  insidious boss  miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day  willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . too excited to pay any attention  the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends  realizing they can make even more money  decide to stage the fake kidnapping . of course  everything that could go wrong does . the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . the more idiotic these characters get  the more reckless the script becomes . at one point  i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : "" no  you idiot ! "" i'm not just talking about willard and rusty  who were extremely annoying  i'm also talking about the cops in this film . a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . they give real cops bad names . also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns  every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . he just didn't belong in this movie . macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was  gross out humor is certainly not his forte . if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy  dirty work  you might actually love this near-sequel . otherwise  don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money .

"united states  1998 u . s . release date : 3/20/98 ( wide ) running length : 1 : 48 mpaa classification : r ( male full-frontal nudity  female topless nudity  graphic sexual activity  frequent profanity  violence ) theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 cast : kevin bacon  matt dillon  neve campbell  theresa russell  denise richards  daphne rubin-vega  carrie snodgress  jeff perry  robert wagner  bill murray director : john mcnaughton producers : steven a . jones  rodney m . liber screenplay : stephen peters cinematography : jeffrey l . kimball music : george s . clinton u . s . distributor : columbia pictures wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day provided  of course  that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy . there is  in fact  no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced  slick  flashy  gleefully mindless  and hollow to the core . wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality  baywatch . wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story . what it is  however  is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast  a spatter of blood  and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen  and that will probably be it . using this approach  i was right three times and wrong only once . that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner . the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot  young cast and the old standby  sex . both have an abundance of screen time  although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqué . the soft-core sex sequences are generic  and don't generate much heat . the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound . theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell  possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract  keeps her clothes more or less on ) . the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . kevin bacon ) is familiar with . the director of wild things is john mcnaughton  whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller  normal life . that movie featured copious sex  a pair of real characters  and a powerful script . it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here  in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture  mad dog and glory  was a box-office disappointment ) . quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws . the main character ( and i use that term lightly  since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon )  a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school . a student  the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards )  has a crush on him . one afternoon  she comes to his house to wash his car  and  when she leaves  her clothing is torn . after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped  she goes to the police station  where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) . they are skeptical about here claims until another girl  suzie toller ( neve campbell )  comes forward with a similar tale . meanwhile  sam  convinced that he's being set up  goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . the acting in wild things isn't very good  but none of the principals have much to work with . this is definitely not a character- based motion picture . not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q .  but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice  but nothing more . matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . neve campbell gets to model the slutty look . denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through  one-piece bathing suit . and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray  and he seems to think he's in comedy  not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) . columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending  which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits  so stay seated )  all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished  kinetic cinematography  wild things always looks great  and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . but  no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is  this is still trash  and  like all garbage  it stinks .

""" spawn "" may be somewhat of an older film . in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is  if they see it ) . but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and  god forbid  video cassette purchasing . it wasn't the worst film of year by any means . it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year . but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten  which  in simpler terms  means it comes in at number 6 on my "" worst of 1997 "" list . the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects  which might actually have been some of the best of the year . performances  however  were either wooden or  for the most part  unforgivingly campy . in fact  this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness ! even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality . i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy  but something about it seemed . . . well  annoyingly unprofessional . john leguizamo almost makes it as clown  but not quite . he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional . but the main problem i found with "" spawn ""  as with most films that wind up on my "" worst of "" lists  is that it was just plain boring . i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film . sure  it had the big battle scene at the end  but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion . never too soon  the movie did conclude in a very simple  disappointing way . even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year  it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again . like i said  the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride  no matter how small . i was impressed with the opening sequence  so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me . and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created . but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes  which looked quite a bit like a modern video game . who knows if "" spawn : the video game "" wasn't part of the plan from the beginning ? keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable  and in a very small amount  makes up for the cheeziness of it all . but none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something i'd recommend seeing  no matter what the price of admission . this movie is definitely not for young children  which shouldn't really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers  if anyone  would likely find it appealing . if you really want to catch a movie  there are many better ones out there  no matter what your tastes might be ! trust me ! "" spawn "" has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers !

"every now and then  reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed . most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact  either good or bad  that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings . but  sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons . i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review . the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary  there were hardly any impression at all  since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it . which surprise me to this day  because the movie theatre was full  i was close to sound speakers  the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show . such things happen very rarely to me  and  after many years  the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself . the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young  aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) . two of them are assigned to cover the train collision . as soon as they meet  they start scooping each other  but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk  and also the romantic feelings they have for each other . the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d'être - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn . movie author  director and screenwriter charles shyer  who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride  tries again  this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts . however  although there is some chemistry between the two  soon it stops to arouse any interest . it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix  that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers . shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two  and fails in both areas  making the story cliched and predictable . the end result is rather forgettable effort  which convinced me not to watch movie again . i'll give it the benefit of the doubt  though .

"american pie 2 ( 2001 ) . starring jason biggs  chris klein  shannon elizabeth  alyson hannigan  natasha lyonne  thomas ian nicholas  chris own  tara reid  seann william scott  mena suvari  eddie kaye thomas and eugene levy . story by david h . steinberg and adam herz . screenplay by adam herz . directed by j . b . rogers . rated r . approx . 115 minutes . american pie 2 is filled with laughs . but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater . i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy . but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment  not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself . what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart . of the original  i noted it was "" a warm  pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . "" well  the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs )  oz ( chris klein )  kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . at least they are a year older  but don't seem any wiser . fresh from their first year of college the quartet  along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott )  rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . as usual nothing goes right until the last reel . but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . for the most part  they are not shown as individuals . they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active  raging hormones . it is telling that the most normal couple  oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she's overseas on an exchange student program . despite having been to college  jim is still klutzy and awkward  unsure of himself around the opposite sex . most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him  including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates  whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . it is offensive and plays upon outdated  adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . the first film  despite some raunchy moments  had an innocent charm to it . the sequel is more cynical . it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch's encounter with stifler's mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy's return as jim's well-meaning  trying-to-be-hip dad . the only performer who is actually given some new  fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle  the band geek from the original . in the sequel  she imbues her character with vulnerability  wisdom and maturity . american pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . it is a shame  though  that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz  who also penned the original  could not have set his sights higher . american pie 2 is funny  but it's still a comedown as well as a letdown . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette  in . he can be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier . com or at bobbloom@iquest . net .  other reviews by bloom can be found at www . jconline . com by clicking on golafayette . bloom's reviews also can be found on the web at the internet movie database : http : //www . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? bob + bloom

"you don't look at a rené magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight . surrealist works are notable for their quirks  and they are fun  but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died  a surrealistic  hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music  occasional screams and weird sound effects  but nobody ever utters an audible word . though the film is distinctive  its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes  and as it progressed  watching became a chore . the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood  the man behind such "" classics "" as plan 9 from outer space and night of the ghouls . the joke  of course  is that his films are so bad  they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . i woke up early the day i died  unfortunatly  is so bad that it's really bad . it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse  escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around  stealing a car  clothes  and a load of money . our thief reaches a cemetery  where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . he falls asleep and finds himself  literally  in a hole  with his money gone . for whatever reason  he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time  why didn't he just go steal some more ? ) . he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for . i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . the subject and the style seem to have been made for it . unfortunately  twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length  and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on  up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is . i woke up early the day i died is a comedy  i guess  though it could have fooled me . unlike most ed wood films  this one tries to be funny and fails  instead of the other way around . there's nothing inherently wrong with that  in fact  i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so "" good "" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll never know  but in either case  this is a failure . jonathan taylor thomas  christina ricci  summer phoenix  john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos . ricci  for example  plays a prostitute . her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out . thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff . was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? zane  meanwhile  occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up . lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature . the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production . it's desperately unfunny  but thinks it's the funniest thing since plan 9 ;  it's so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction . i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send-off . ©1999 eugene novikov &#137 ; sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ share what you know . learn what you don't .

"director : roland emmerich writer : dean devlin and roland emmerich starring : james spader  kurt russel  jaye davidon  french stewart to put it bluntly  ed wood would have been proud of this . a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor  hokey drama  zero logic and a crap screenplay . also  a beautifully anti-climactic ending . not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews . so much for truth in advertising . roland emmerich  who's later "" independence day "" would look like "" the 400 blows "" compared to this  co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens . in a useless opening sequence  men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it . it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out . they're decipherer ? a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist )  dr . dan jackson ( james spader  doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word . why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? so there is a hokey ending ! duh ! he figures it out in about a minute . yea . and then they get a suicidal colonel or something  "" jack "" o'neill ( kurt russel  with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) . why a suicidal colonel ? for the ending ! you'll get the hang of this . they open the stargate  a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad . after an overdone special effects thing  they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid . so they went to egypt  right ? wrong . they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt . they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra  the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson  with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma )  and there are fights  explosions and a kiss between two people . yea . also melodrama  stupidity  hokey scenes and a bizarre language . an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( "" say hello to king tut  asswhole !

""" saving silverman "" is a good example of a good comedy gone bad . as a love story it is good  however as a comedy it falls flat on it's face . i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . . and those were just chuckles at the most ! the movie doesn't have the oomph to make it a great movie  and doesn't have the script to make it a funny movie . wayne lefessier ( steven zahn )  j . d . mcnugent ( jack black )  and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together  they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end . while in a bar after doing a show with their band  based on their love of neil diamond  darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for . wayne and j . d . however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again  it's up to wayne and j . d . to try and begin saving silverman . the performances are topnotch and surprisingly  they are what keep the movie afloat . jason biggs right off the flop "" loser "" does an ok job playing silverman  but he is stale and flat at times . steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier  and even though the movie is about silverman  lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself . jack black is well jack black  and he does an all right job as j . d . but he isn't as funny as he has been in the past . amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith  and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( he's better at singing than acting ) . anyway the performances in the film are good  but it's too bad the script isn't . speaking of script  hank nelkan's choppy script is not only badly written  but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street . the trailer for the movie  as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie  especially the funniest parts . somewhere "" saving silverman "" was meant to be a good movie  and it could have been  but alas in the end it wasn't . dennis dugan's direction is all right  he adds a few directorial touches here and there  nothing special being a simple comedy . "" saving silverman "" is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one . it has a great cast  a good director and a sweet story . . . it's just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie . reviewed by brandon herring 3-11-00 .

"i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . the problem is  i can't remember them as i write this review . that's not a good sign . in booty call  jamie foxx is bunz  a character whom i can't really describe  because i don't know that much about him . i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk  and that he doesn't like relationships  just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions  no commitment ) . bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson )  who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow  and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks  wow ! ) . rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend  nikki ( tamala jones )  but for a reason which is not totally explained  it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox )  who have never met . to make a long story short  the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex . first she wants condoms  so bunz and rushon go out and get them . oh  no  they have to be latex  not lambskin . back to the store . now they've got to get dental dams  or there'll be no foreplay . why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? nikki phones lysterine  who lives across the hall  and tells her she'd better be making these demands  too . talk about coitus interruptus . booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . the difference between the two is that in the latter  things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . in this category  for example  you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side  and airplane ! at the extreme . there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status  but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . it is disappointing  and even worse  distracting . there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) does not live up to its potential  as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . for instance  there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese  much to everyone's surprise . however  when asked how he learned the language  he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films  and soon gained mastery . this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . if  on the other hand  when asked how he learned to speak chinese  bunz simply replied with  "" kung-fu movies  "" and then moved on  the joke would have been much more effective . this is because it would have been totally unbelievable  but funny because we know it is unbelievable . by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible  the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex  why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ? these questions are not answered by the screenplay  but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . some movies use a lot of swear words  but use them under very justifiable circumstances  as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech . other films  such as the recent jackie brown  use them in ways that almost parody themselves . booty call just sticks them in to get laughs  and it doesn't work . they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . the chinese restaurant  a holdup at a convenience store  and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story  and are in there for filler . this is surprising  considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better  since it is comprised of sometimes funny  but forgettable dialog . i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .

"directed by john carpenter . cast : james woods  daniel baldwin  sheryl lee  thomas ian griffith  maximillian schell  tom guinee . 1998 - 105 minutes . rated r ( for violence  profanity  gore  nudity  and sexual situations ) . reviewed october 31  1998 . by dustin putman  dustin putman's film reviews  there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director . of course  his best film was 1978's masterpiece  "" halloween  "" but he also made 1980's "" the fog  "" and 1987's underrated  "" prince of darkness . "" heck  he even made a good film in 1995  with "" in the mouth of madness . "" but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992  with the terrible comedy  "" memoirs of an invisible man . "" somehow  carpenter has lost his touch  with junk like his failed 1995 remake of  "" village of the damned  "" to his uninspired 1996 sequel  "" escape from l . a . "" those movies  however  look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film  "" john carpenter's vampires . "" if i was him  i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title . it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as  "" vampires . "" the story is simple . jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who  along with one of his partners  montoya ( daniel baldwin )  and a prostitute  katrina ( sheryl lee )  survives an attack from the master vampire  valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . since katrina was previously bitten by him  crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later  and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her . it seems valek's mission is to steal a black  wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him . my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? well  the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made . "" john carpenter's vampires  "" sadly enough  is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen . in fact  there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time . the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed  without any interesting camera work  which is usually a trademark of carpenter's . and then we come to the screenplay  which  as far as i can tell  is nearly non-existent . there is no story development  and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters . james woods can be a good actor  but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue . daniel baldwin has some potential  but his character comes off as being very dense . and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" )  like all of the female characters  plays an offensive stereotypical whore . there is not an ounce of intelligence  or excitement in  "" john carpenter's vamires  "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's . he has said that he turned down directing  "" halloween : h20  "" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it . and yet  when asked about a "" vampires "" sequel  he said he would be happy to do it . i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent  not to mention a significant number of iq points .

"directed by : jan de bont written by : david shelf  based upon a novel by shirley jackson cast : liam neeson  cathrine zeta jones  lili taylor  lili taylor  marian seldes the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" . so i didn't expect too much from this . but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . i thought : liam neeson  cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . i thought  mabe it will be fun ? and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones  jan de bont ? . these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house  visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones )  a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . actually  the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . but he gets unexpected help from the house itself . it rumbles  hums and belches forth remarkable sights . portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real  placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . is that exciting or what ? the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad . it's based on a great book  ``the haunting of hill house  '' by shirley jackson . a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . "" the blair witch project ""  that cost less than an old car  managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . and with a $70 mill . budget  de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is  in itself  frightening . he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . but why give him a more serious material ? in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director . yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad . the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful  mysterious  magical and spooky . but this is where the good things end . the music is blaring  the floors moving  the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this  every second  every moment of screen time  is absolutely without life . it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive  but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage . at first you do not know what's going on . is this part of the experiment ? are these hallucinations ? projections of the subconscience ? paranoia ? but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . the house is actually possessed . it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . for ever  i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? i believe hichock once said that "" it's better to wait for a climax  than to see one "" . this may be true  and it might actually work  but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary  only stupid . they are impossible to take seriously . any paralells that you might have heard before  linking this picture to kubrick's "" the shining ""  are absolutely baseless . "" shining "" had class  style  story  acting  but most of all talent and originality . "" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . casting good actors for small  pale parts only makes things worse . but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write  most of you will see this film anyway  even if the tagline would say : "" some films are just born stupid "" .

"principal cast : marie gignac  robert lapage  celine bonnier director/screenwriter : peter mettler based on the play by robert lapage in english and french with subtitles tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage  and  while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production  the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . tectonic plates has a storyline  although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion  with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious  all-but-screaming  "" look ! art ! "" )  although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie  it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . they're not real  sympathetic  or believable . i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different  but this particular experiment is not a success . tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac )  an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor  jacques ( lapage ) . one day  he disappears  and  fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love  madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . while preparing to commit suicide  she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier )  who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . meanwhile  jacques has moved to new york city  where he starts cross-dressing  calls himself jennifer  and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland  supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute  and cultural references that point to chopin  george sand  and jim morrison  tectonic plates is unique  if nothing else . however  as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising )  it never really delivers . the tone is soporific  the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting  the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant )  and the symbolism is obvious . tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth  but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . there are some worthwhile moments  such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different  ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before  and ( c ) it's pretentious . for everyone else  it's not only a waste of time  but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .

""" goodbye  lover "" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may  and one look will tell you why . it's a mess . and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that  in this case  required the services of three screenwriters . i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller  one wrote a murder mystery  and one wrote a comedy  then director roland joffé tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse  a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip  but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is "" at least she died healthy . "" and that's one of her wittier asides . degeneres' sgt . rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . it's best described this way : sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake  a "" creative yet unfocused "" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep  played by dermot mulroney . sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . ben is also coming on to his petite  mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone  somewhere  is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . although there are some genuine surprises  the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears . at least the former "" ellen "" star is going for something a little different . arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled  platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : "" lost highway  "" "" true romance "" ) while quoting embarrassing lines like "" i'm not wearing any underwear . "" i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity . sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers . she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite "" the sound of music "" on her car stereo  intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . so what was the point of the wig and the car ? "" the sound of music "" stuff might be a reference to "" the wizard of oz "" allusions in david lynch's "" wild at heart  "" but if so joffé must have forgotten that "" wild at heart "" was a despicable movie . it's hard to believe that "" goodbye  lover "" was directed by the same person who made "" the killing fields "" and "" the mission . "" it's not  however  hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . it should have stayed there .

"" ( my sentiments exactly ) bob : "" well  you know  people are talking about you and gertrude ( or something like that  i just remember her name started with a "" g "" ) . "" sly : "" if people are talking it's because you gave them something to talk about . "" now  bear in mind  this is at the very start of the film . we don't know who gertrude is  who bob ( that's not the character's name  but that's what i kept mentally calling him ) is  what jack's job is  what in the world is going on . already i was starting to not really care all that much . none of these questions are ever fully answered ( especially not the last one )  and i never did start caring what was going on . i tried my best though dang it  i tried to get into this story  but i couldn't . it was too . . . too . . . what's the word i'm looking for ? stupid ! that's it . as for the actors  first up we have the great sly stallone . sly's career has been on the rocks lately  and he . . . uhh . . line ? sorry  sly's career has been on the rocks  and he needed a boost to rev-reval-revitilz . . . line ? sly needed this movie to revitalize his diminishing career  after box-office failures such as . . . uhh . . line ? forget it  take five . sorry about that folks  but sly's acting in "" get carter "" really is that bad . the man looks completely lost during half his scenes  and i'm willing to wager they took several hundred takes before he got it right . during a few of the so-called "" dramatic "" moments  he has long pauses during his varied speeches  during which he gazes into the distance for dramatic effect . i'm sorry  but it looks like he forgot his lines and is looking desperately for cue cards somewhere . miranda richardson ( "" sleepy hollow "" )  is wasted in nearly every movie she appears in these days  that trend doesn't change with "" get carter "" . the great michael caine ( "" the cider house rules "" ) is completely wasted as the brother's friend and boss . i didn't think it was possible for mickey rourke ( "" the rainmaker "" ) to be considered wasted ( i'm usually fairly happy when he has limited screen time )  but it was pulled off here . robin leigh cook ( "" she's all that "" ) plays robin leigh cook to the hilt  looking vaguely like a deer caught in the headlights of a semi ; and the less said about alan cumming ( "" titus "" ) the better off we'll all be . don't ask me to explain bob's ( john c . mcginley ) presence  or the character's significance in the story  because i can't . i don't get it . how does a movie this bad get made in this day and age ? don't the studios read the scripts before green-lighting a film ? guess not . i'd like to say that in the hands of a more capable director this could have been something  but that's not the case . still  the direction ( if you can call it that ) from relative newcomer stephan t . kay doesn't help matters . to start with  i like a movie that throws me right into the middle of the plot ; a movie that skips all that often pointless exposition of plot that will be revealed again later on . what i don't like is a movie that throws us into the middle of things and never explains itself  and "" get carter "" is just that kind of movie . kay seems to consider himself something of an oliver stone fan  since he's fond of quick cuts all over the place  sudden shifts to slow motion  and anything else he can think of to "" dazzle "" the eye . yet while stone's technique is irritating  kay's is excruciating . i didn't think it was possible to mangle a car chase to the point where you could no longer tell who was driving what  or who just smashed into whom  but kay manages to do it . or how about this ? sly walks up the stairs  putting on leather gloves and getting ready to crack some skulls . rather than just filming sly walking up the stairs  kay films sly walking up the stairs in quick little bursts . first he's at the bottom  then half-way up  then at the top . why was it filmed like this ? possibly to make the film look more artistic ( heh )  but your guess is as good as mine . next up we have the dialogue  which is amusingly bad at its best  painful at its worst . here are a few examples : "" you've got as much chance as a one legged man in an a * * kicking contest . "" gee  clever sly  never heard that one before . sly approaches alan cumming on that neat looking golf course . alan : "" who are you ? "" sly : "" tiger woods . "" wow  that was clever too . mickey rourke  referring to his eyes : "" are they still pretty ? "" sly : "" yeah  pretty like cat urine in the snow . "" now that was really clever . one of my "" favorite "" lines from sly was "" we're going to take this to the next level . "" he only says it twice  but it was old the first time . hey sly  how about taking your acting to the next level ? didn't think so . the film's score  from composer tyler bates is grating  obnoxious  and fairly useless . "" get carter "" runs an unholy 115 minutes  which should have been cut down to . . uh . . well it just should have been cut . i'd recommend the movie to those who think stallone was jilted when he didn't get an oscar nomination for "" judge dredd ""  and give the film a much deserved one out of five stars . one last note  i know i had a full plot summary up there  but here's the real plot : jack asks question  person won't answer  jack threatens then with cheesy catch phrase or twists a limb till they cry uncle  person answers . what's the final threat of the movie ? possible sequel is hinted at . uncle ! uncle ! comments ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . netpast reviews can be found at : http : //www . epinions . com/user-elerad or http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? john + beachem * * * * * - one of the best movies of the year . * * * * - great flick  try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie  hits and misses . * * - pretty bad  see it at your own risk . * - see this one only if you enjoy pain . get your private  free e-mail from msn hotmail at http : //www . hotmail . com .  share information about yourself  create your own public profile at http : //profiles . msn . com .

"swordfish ( 2001 ) . starring john travolta  hugh jackman  halle berry  don cheadle  vinnie jones and sam shepard . written by skip woods . directed by dominic sena . rated r . at the outset of swordfish  john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . basically  he says  it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . how ironic  as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . swordfish is loud  violent and amoral . it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . swordfish is a very cynical movie . it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human  faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down  you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . this is a live-action road runner cartoon  moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman )  recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . talk about whacked-out patriotism . my objections to swordfish are many . the body count is high  but that is expected in a movie of this sort . it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers  police officers and government agents blown to bits . another example is the family dynamics between stanley  his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . stanley  though having served time in prison for hacking  is shown as a loving and caring father  forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . thus when she is found murdered late in the movie  neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . in fact  subconsciously  many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . children as pawns have become a most unwelcome cliché in recent films . there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . yea  it's only make believe  but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . travolta is cool  deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant  while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . and maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of  only those doing their upmost to survive . and that is not enough . this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette  in . he can be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier . com or at bobbloom@iquest . net .  bloom's reviews also can be found at www . jconline . com by clicking on golafayette . bloom's reviews also can be found on the web at the internet movie database : http : //www . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? bob + bloom

"die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco  inferior to the original in every respect . place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson  who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower  leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . the film has zero credibility  and all of the characters come off as cliched  cardboard cut-outs . so much for the script . how about the action ? well  let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan  who directed the original  as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . by contrast  harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action  and consequently  die hard 2 never picks up steam . die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . in fact  the movie often seems deliberately campy  and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good . you do laugh  but you laugh at the film  not with it . die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .

"directed by delbert mann written by paddy chayefsky ( from his play ) cast : ernest borgnine  betsy blair  esther minciotti  joe mantell . my favourite film of all time is james mangold's heavy  which i first saw on the day before new year's eve 1995 . heavy is about the life of man who is paralysed by a lack of confidence and starts to slowly awaken when he falls in love with a young waitress . i can attribute my passionate interest in the world of cinema directly to that film . of course i had always gone to the movies before  but only a handful of times a year and only to see the latest blockbuster like et and batman etc . . heavy was a turning point for me because i hadn't seen many films up to then which moved me so profoundly and actually reflected things in my own life . it was while reading through the many reviews of heavy on the internet  that i noticed one reviewer referred to the similarities between the lead character  victor in heavy and marty in marty . i finally saw marty last night  having stumbled upon a copy of it in a london record store . when i read the description on the back of the video box  i thought it probably couldn't be anywhere near as good as it sounds . thankfully  i was wrong and it turned out to be a truly wonderful film that far exceeded my already high expectations . marty tells the story of a butcher called marty ( ernest borgnine ) who lives and works in the bronx  new york . he is 35 years old and is still living with his mother ( played superbly by esther minciotti ) . they are an italian family and practising catholics . marty is the oldest of all the children and the only one not yet married . a fact that he is constantly reminded of by his friends and customers  and of course his mother who is desperate to see her son married . marty is not a shy man  like victor in heavy  but is very gentle in nature and in his own words is a "" short  fat  ugly man "" . he refers to himself this way throughout the film . marty tells his mother that he has given up on finding a girlfriend . he has tried very hard but is constantly rejected  he tells her  and he can't stand any more pain his mother won't listen to any of this and urges marty to go to a ballroom in town where marty's cousin has said there are "" a lot of tomatoes "" - that's tomatoes said in a very broad new york accent "" ta-may-tas "" ! ! when marty's mother tells marty this  it is very amusing the way she says it and it makes marty laugh  as well as us the audience ! marty does go to the ballroom and he takes along his best friend  angie ( joe mantell ) . angie is about marty's age and is also unattached . the two of them often spend their saturday nights together in their fruitless search for women  and often wind up drinking beer  watching the hit parade at marty's house ! angie finds a dancing partner very quickly but marty is turned down and left hanging around the edge of the dancefloor alone . marty is approached by a man on a blind date who has found that his partner is  in his words  "" a dog "" and asks marty if he will take her home in return for 5 dollars . marty finds the idea objectionable and refuses . quite right too ! however marty watches as a man with less scruples than himself takes the money and wanders over to "" the dog "" . this man takes one look at her and soon decides to walk off leaving the young lady alone and in tears . this has got to be one of the cruellest things i have seen in a long time . unspeakably hurtful . marty sees this and being the good hearted man he is  he goes over to where she ran off to cry  to comfort her . marty talks to her and finds out she is called clara  and is a 29 year old school teacher . they soon find out that they have lots in common . both are unattached and living at home with their parents and they both have given up hope of ever marrying . tragically too  they both admit to thinking of themselves as "" dogs "" . to hear them both use this term is quite shocking since it is a terribly cruel slur that i had thought was a british term and a relatively recent one at that . to hear two americans using this term in the 1950s came as a surprise . much more shocking is the way both marty and clara not only feel they are dogs but actually say to each other that they are . they hit it off pretty much instantly and a more likeable screen couple it would be hard to find . they are both so genuine and decent that the minute they meet you know that they would be a great couple . they spend the rest of the night talking to each other about themselves . marty and clara both admit having had suicidal feelings  which marty feels particularly guilty about due his catholicism . when clara tells marty that she finds she has been crying a lot lately  marty immediately tells her that he too is always crying at the smallest thing . this is a great moment . it's not often you hear men in movies admitting that they cry  but marty is a sensitive man and not afraid to admit it . not that marty is a big girl's blouse ! ( far from it  we see that marty has a group of male friends who he goes drinking with  and in one scene we see marty and his mates sitting around his house  while his friends look at girlie mags ) . when his friends get to hear that marty has been seeing a "" dog ""  as marty's mate angie probably put it  they refuse to entertain the idea that he could possibly be serious about her . she doesn't fit with their ideal image of women  which they seem to have been brainwashed with by the women in mickey spillane novels ! * this bothers marty who is very serious about clara  and is obviously miffed when his friends are so dismissive . marty's mother also takes a dislike to clara  even going so far as to say that clara is unattractive  but this is only due to her sudden realisation that she is about to lose marty . the big question is  will marty ignore those around him and stick with clara ? what do you think ? ! * ( as an aside  in the scene where marty's friends are enthusing about the books of mickey spillane  the line "" that mickey spillane is a great writer ""  is uttered three times  with the scene ending on this line . it sounded awfully like the filmmakers were gently having a dig at mickey spillane . that marty's friends were fans is not in doubt  but it did seem to me that the references were somewhat sarcastic in nature ! ) marty is one of those films that surprises you with how authentic and real the situations and dialogue are  especially when you realise it was made over 40 years ago . everything marty and clara says  you can imagine people saying and feeling now . i know this shouldn't be so surprising  since people feel the same things now as they ever did . the difference is that dialogue in films is rarely as sharp and perceptive and  more importantly  as natural as it is in marty . the screenplay was by paddy chayefsky who i'm delighted to say won an oscar for his magnificent screenplay . there were so many great lines of dialogue but one that really made me smile was marty's mother and aunt saying that "" college girls were one step from the street "" ! marty response to this was appropriately contemptful . i loved the scene where marty tells clara that they are both deluding themselves by saying that they live at home for the sake of their parents  when they both knew that in a way they felt they needed their parents . clara hit the nail on the head for me when she said she had avoided getting a car  because she says she had a fear of killing someone in a crash . i have often felt this way myself ! another moment that stood out as being especially real and authentic was during the scene at the church when marty's cousin says he and his wife will sit at the back of the church with their baby  so as to reduce the disruption to the service . it's not a line i've heard in a film before  but it sounded so great hearing it in this film . in truth  to pick out individual moments is unfair  as the whole film is a joy from beginning to end  with every line of dialogue sparkling ! the acting throughout is excellent  but ernest borgnine and betsy blair are both exceptional . borgnine makes marty the most natural  kind hearted  genuine man you're ever likely to see in a film . marty is a difficult role as it would be easy to overdo the sentimentality and make marty seem a bit pathetic and wet . borgnine gives marty a strong character who is far from weak and is the sort of bloke who you would feel proud and privileged to know . betsy blair was nominated for best supporting actress ( why it wasn't best actress  i don't know )  and is frankly astonishing in a role that in many ways is even more demanding than that of marty . clara is said throughout the film to be unattractive and this must be hard to keep hearing  for the actress . betsy blair is far from ugly  but is made to look very plain and this must be quite a brave thing for an actress to do . she imbues clara with dignity from the start and again  like borgnine  underplays and gives an incredibly quiet and very subtle performance . they are both are so good it's frightening . as a tribute to their wonderful acting burt lancaster who appears in a 1955 trailer for the film ( he co-produced marty ) says that they were so good that it made "" him feel proud to be an actor "" . this is high praise indeed  and so well said ! my only criticism would be that the ending is so abrupt that i was left in despair when the film credits suddenly started . i couldn't bear for the film to end ! the end credits soon made up for my disappointment by featuring a great song called "" hey  marty "" which was played over the cast credits  complete with small clips of the cast as their names appeared . a great end to a great film . i urge people to see this glorious film and i am looking forward to seeing this many more times during the rest of my life . awards for marty year - 1955 oscar best picture -winner oscar best director- delbert mann- winner oscar best actor- ernest borgnine- winner oscar best writing  screenplay -paddy chayefsky - winner golden globe best actor - ernest borgnine - winner director guild award for outstanding directorial achievement in motion pictures - delbert mann - winner

"in the mid-1980s  following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film  it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere . but  it wasn't meant to be  which became obvious following highlander ii . in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . very often such films were science fiction  which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert . whether it was because of real lack of talent  terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible . the same can be said for fortress  1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon  director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond . the movie is set in 2018 . for some undisclosed reason  usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child . jake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border . sentenced to 31 years in prison  they are both thrown into fortress  privately owned correctional facility  equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed . although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible  prison authorities often use violence . jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape . such escape should become necessity  because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen . after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison  this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity . the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clichés and situations that are painfully predictable . by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress  those situations not only begin to look predictable  but utterly implausible too . of course  film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society . the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters  played by not too interested or talented actors . lori laughlin  although physically attractive  shows the acting ability of sequoia . kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired  capable of solid  yet forgettable performance . lambert's performance is also good  but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film  destined to end in oblivion .

"wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . over black and white drawings  we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange  sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation . the "" original "" inhabitants of the earth  fairies and elves  return to populate the globe  along with their evil  mutant counterparts . one day ( and i say "" one day "" not to be trite  but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice )  a fairy queen gives birth to twins  one good and one evil . the twins grow up to be powerful wizards  the good one embracing magic  and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . as unoriginal as the premise is  i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world  after all . i soon learned  however  that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . once the transition was made from still art to color animation  an entirely different feel takes precedence . rather than the epic saga promised by the narration  we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon . not just the look  mind you  but all the zany sounds like >honk< and >boing< when the characters go jumping around like . . . . well  like cartoon characters . when we see blackwolf  the evil twin wizard  he's pretty much what we expect . the good wizard  avatar  is nothing like he is depicted in the opening . rather than a sagely master  he's more like george burns  complete with stogie in foot . that's right  he holds it between his toes . he doesn't even look the like he did in the black and white drawings . how disappointing . papa smurf and santa claus are serious wisemen compared to this guy . i imagine yoda picks guys like avatar out from between his teeth on weekends . for years  blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good  since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined . however  blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . yup  adolf hitler  the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . okay  not the real things  but an archival film his minions dug up . projected into the sky for all to see  it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . before you know it  there are dead elves everywhere . this is just as well . the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them . they're either silly  sappy  or both . the dialog gets much of the credit for this . an example is when avatar nonchalantly says  "" well  looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . "" not very formidable when he's also the guy who says  "" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on . "" my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil . her response is  "" they have weapons and technology . we just have love . "" suffice to say  the characters are strictly two-dimensional  and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen . which it does . the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out  which is anticlimactic and disappointing . please note that it is the action that is unexpected . that it is disappointing is not . the film couldn't settle on a particular mood . it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity . the dramatics  which seem to occur at random  are overly staged and overly acted  detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned . ralph bakshi  the director  makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . so who doesn't know this already ? well  maybe children . okay  so you might say that this is a movie for children . it's not . in the scenes where good fights evil  there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon . so is the film for adults ? if so  we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point . why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes  and hitler giving speeches . however  we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad . we see no atrocities being committed  not even any real battle footage . there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich  and we're not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place . this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made  since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . i'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere  at any time  and we must therefore be vigilant . however  i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit .

"outside providence ( m ) . ( miramax/village roadshow ) director : michael corrente stars : shawn hatosy  alec bladwin  amy smart  tommy bone  jonathan brandis  jon abrahams  adam la vorgna  gabriel mann  jack ferver  jesse leach  kristen shorten  alex toma  george wendt  tim crowe  george martin  richard jenkins  mike cerrone  robert turano . set in pawtucket  rhode island  in 1974  outside providence is a sensitive but largely uninspiring coming of age tale about a teenage slacker from the wrong side of the tracks who eventually finds wisdom . somewhat surprisingly  this sensitive coming of age tale comes from bobby and peter farrelly  the film making siblings better known for their deliberately dumb and low brow sense of humour that shaped the clever and hilarious there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . outside providence centres around 17 year old tim dunphy ( shawn hatosy  recently seen in the faculty  etc )  affectionately known as "" dildo "" by his gruff  embittered  widowed working class father ( alec baldwin ) . tim protects his wheelchair-bound younger brother jackie ( tommy bone )  and hangs out with his slacker mates ( including an almost unrecognisable jonathan brandis  best known for his role in seaquest ) . his father plays cards and drinks beers with his close mates  while they discuss such world shattering events as watergate and whether or not rock hudson is gay . following a minor traffic accident in which he rear ends a police car while driving without a licence and engulfed in a fugue of drug smoke  tim is promptly packed off to cornwall  an exclusive preparatory academy . a misfit and a rebel  he struggles against the strict rules and regulations of the college  and clashes with his humourless dormitory head . much of the film also focuses on his developing relationship with the beautiful jane ( amy smart  from varsity blues  etc )  who attends the nearby girl's school . outside providence is based on peter farrelly's own semi-autobiographical novel  although the material lacks anything of real substance or interest to say . the brothers put their predilection for crass toilet humour and hilarious sight gags on hold  for the duration . they have handed over directorial chores to co-writer michael corrente ( american buffalo  etc )  who brings a touch of restraint and sensitivity to the material . lacking eye catching gags about zippers  hair gel  flatulence and dead dogs  outside providence is a rather straightforward and bland tale that ultimately lacks broad appeal . it's difficult to feel any sense of empathy towards the characters and their exploits . the performances from the young  largely unknown cast are solid . hatosy makes the most of his role as the likeable rogue  but he occasionally struggles with the uninteresting material . cast largely against type  baldwin delivers a restrained but insightful and sensitive performance as tim's gruff but ultimately understanding father  and he brings more complexity to the role than was originally on paper . outside providence is strongly reminiscent of richard linklater's 1993 slacker generation comedy dazed and confused  although it lacks the same wicked  anarchic edge . the film also lacks anything of real substance or interest to say . director corrente fails to imbue this disappointing blend of comedy and drama with any real sense of nostalgia  apart from the superb soundtrack of early '70's hits that will strike a chord with audiences old enough to remember those halcyon days .

"the marketers of hudson hawk obviously have a lot more talent than the filmmakers . misguided and miscalculated on every conceivable level  hudson hawk is the most lame-brained  stupefyingly awful movie to have come around in a long time . director michael lehmann ( heathers ) has taken a promising idea and turned it into a mind-boggling misfire  a sorry spectacle of a film that even the most die hard bruce willis fans will abhor . the movie's wooden and empty-headed plot revolves around master cat burglar eddie "" hudson hawk  "" played by willis . he's hired to steal three priceless da vinci artifacts by a variety of odious villains -- the mario brothers  george kaplan and the candy bars  and a pair of kinky and colorful miscreants  darwin and minerva mayflower ( played to the hilt by richard e . grant and sandra bernhard ) . the plan is to unlock the secrets of leonardo's puzzle  three rubik's cube-like crystals which  when put together correctly  are said to provide instant wealth and gratification . pity the same couldn't be said of the film . the hawk is aided and abetted by long time partner-in-crime and confidante tommy five-tone ( danny aiello of do the right thing ) . they get to perform a couple of gratuitously surreal musical numbers together  which shows you just how low this film will sink in order to get a laugh . andie macdowell ( sex  lies and videotape ) plays willis' love interest  anna baragli . lovely  yes  but interesting ? not in this movie . you know where the film's heading when it manages to poke fun at asians  the handicapped and overweight people all within the first five minutes . by its long overdue conclusion  everyone else in between -- including the audience -- has been insulted . the best thing in the film are the mayflowers  who resemble characters in a john waters movie . bernhard has a field day in her role as minerva  a garishly outfitted  rubber-faced dominatrix who gets off on psychologically ridiculing the mawkish hawk . her performance is hideously over the top  but that's what makes it all the more fun to watch . and grant's despotic darwin delivers what few funny lines there are in the film . waters  the director of such sleazoid epics as pink flamingos and polyester  has said that bad taste is what entertainment is all about . but in hudson hawk  lehmann abuses the privilege . apparently the film had more than its fair share of production problems  discernible from the opening credits . willis -- who must take a large part of the blame for this embarrassment -- co-wrote the story with executive producer robert kraft . kraft  in turn  shares screen credit with composer michael kamen ( die hard and the "" lethal weapon "" series ) . kamen was supposedly still working on the score days before the film was released . and it shows . the sound  too  is so bad you can't often hear what the characters are saying . and the film is poorly edited -- some snatches of footage are so short you're not quite sure what you are supposed to have seen . all this in a movie reputed to have cost upwards of $75 million !

"united states  1998 u . s . release date : 5/20/98 ( wide ) running length : 2 : 12 mpaa classification : pg-13 ( typical monster movie disaster scenario ) theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 cast : matthew broderick  jean reno  hank azaria  maria pitillo  kevin dunn  michael lerner  harry shearer  arabella field director : roland emmerich producers : dean devlin screenplay : dean devlin  roland emmerich cinematography : ueli steiger music : david arnold u . s . distributor : tristar pictures godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie . a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie  godzilla  king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department )  roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . the script isn't just "" dumbed down  "" it's lobotomized . godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . presumably  the primary target group for this film is teenage boys  the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible . this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . stargate was a financial success . independence day was a runaway hit . and  with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens  it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . godzilla isn't completely without merit  although it is close . there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan  but it wears off quickly . frankly  while the special effects are competent  they're not all that stunning . there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens  with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . godzilla never really pushes the envelope  preferring to remain within a comfort zone . the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass  formulaic approach which disallows creativity . ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) worst of all  godzilla isn't even exciting . with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end  there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . independence day may have been dumb  but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . in this aspect of its production  as in so many others  godzilla is lacking . actually  part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . the plot  such as it is  can be summed up rather simply . after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands  godzilla shows up in the big apple . he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden  visits the chrysler building  goes on a walk through central park  and takes the subway . in the process  he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs  but he never has trouble with traffic jams . on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit  led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos  who has a theory about godzilla . in his opinion  the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . in nick's words  godzilla is "" a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind . "" as luck would have it  nick's old girlfriend  audrey ( maria pitillo )  is a reporter based at a new york tv station . along with her cameraman friend  animal ( hank azaria )  she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . then  just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york  a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . instead of stomping around tokyo this time  godzilla has chosen new york city . unfortunately  manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day  deep impact  armageddon ) that it's becoming boring . the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong  but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . he could climb the empire state building . at ten times that height  godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material  an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly  and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : "" ebert  "" the mayor of new york  is played by michael lerner  and "" gene "" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . ebert's re-election slogan is  not surprisingly  "" thumbs up for new york . "" the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it's used  but  after a while  it grows tiresome . and  although the "" characters "" don't serve any real purpose  they keep popping up . godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . this is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . that's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past )  but they aren't a-list names . then again  considering the quality of the writing  even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . ultimately  it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic  for that matter ) have to say about the movie . tristar has assumed that godzilla  like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures  is pretty much critic-proof . it may also be word-of-mouth-proof . those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . so  when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time  it's like spitting into the wind . emmerich and devlin are master illusionists  waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . it's probably too much to hope that some day  movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had .

"directed by ivan reitman . screenplay by david diamond  david weissman and don jakoby  based on a story by jakoby . starring david duchovny  orlando jones  julianne moore . running time : 104 minutes . rated pg for frightening scenes by the mfcb . reviewed on august 27th  2001 . synopsis : when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert  community college professors ira kane ( duchovny ) and harry block ( jones ) are first on the scene . they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate . soon the army  advised by dr allison reed ( moore )  moves in and forces kane and block out . but when the aliens begin to menace society  it may take the scientists' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity . review : "" evolution "" certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy . it's directed by reitman  clearly trying to parlay his "" ghostbusters "" success into a twenty-first-century counterpart . it stars duchovny  and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his "" x-files "" character so soon after leaving the tv series  it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition . and then there's moore  who may not have much prior experience in comedy  but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress . a shame  then  that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass . "" evolution "" is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script . it has its moments ( a scene in which jones' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining )  but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour . moore is totally wasted  her clumsy shtick getting very old  very fast . duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with . and the story is so formulaic  it could have been written by monkeys . part of what made "" ghostbusters "" so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for . "" evolution "" is so mind-numbingly tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens . copyright © 2001 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery  http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies . html | shannon patrick sullivan | shannon@mun . ca | + --------------------------------- + --------------------------------- + / doctor who : a brief history of time ( travel ) go . to/drwho-history \ \__ we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars __/

"silent fall has the shreds and shards of a far better movie lurking around inside it somewhere . it takes the form of a psychological thriller  where the detectives work hand-in-glove with psychiatrists to disentangle the mind of a witness to a murder . the witness is an autistic little boy  and there are strong hints that he is probably the killer as well -- after all  they found him swinging the knife while standing over his parent's corpses . richard dreyfuss is the psychiatrist  and it is to his credit that he does the best job he can in a movie of such abysmal silliness . he has one very nice scene where he uses a deck of cards as a metaphor for how to jog the kid's memory . unfortunately  like so many other ham-handed scripts  the metaphor is hammered on again and again until its initial charm collapses . i had high hopes going into this movie . for the most part  psychiatrists get short shrift in films : they get portrayed as soulless technicians ( one flew over the cuckoo's nest )  or fiendish maniacs ( bad dreams )  or goofy and ineffectual softies ( amos & andrew ) . dreyfuss plays a fellow with smarts and presence  and he does a decent job of soldiering on while the film collapses around him . john lithgow gets dragged in for a wasteful little cameo as a drug-dispensing doctor  which reminded me of what a good actor he is when he's not in junk like this . the movie has so few real ideas about its alleged subjects that it's distressing . take  for instance  the murder investigation . if you were a cop  would you let the children of the murder victims live in their house while it would still be a crime scene ? the movie's insights into autism are also pretty much nonexistent . autism  like the rest of the movie's conceits with psychology  are just cheap hooks onto which to hang the rest of the plot . and if there is another thriller out there with a more contrived mess of a plot than this one -- write me  i've got cigars . the film's big climax has dreyfuss getting the kid to re-enact almost on cue what he witnessed . never mind if the people in the movie watching this thought it was believable : did anyone filming it think it was believable ? really ?

" directed by greg arraki starring james duval  rachel true  kathleen robertson  ryan phillippe  sarah lassez  christina applegate gregg araki's the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made . so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ? first of all  some of the reviews were fairly positive . also  the cast  consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight  eve plumb  shannen doherty  and david leisure ) was promising . last of all  i wanted to give arraki one more chance . i mean  the guy can't be that untalented  can he ? the answer to that question is three letters long . nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles . since arraki doesn't know how to make anything coherent  it's hard to describe the plot . let's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls . the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star . he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans . this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming . it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki  and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez . i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft . he works better with the camera this time around  especially in the early scenes . halfway through the film  i didn't necessarily find myself enjoying the film  but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation . then as the movie went on  arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads  twisted sex games  and alien abductions . it's sad  because he almost actually had some decent material here  but he ruined it with his usual in your face "" i'm such a renegade maverick filmmaker  look what i can do "" attitude . the performances are generally better than in the doom generation  which isn't saying much . at least we don't have to suffer jonathan "" i am the most hideous man in america "" schaech . we are  however treated to another round of james "" i'm more wooden than keanu "" duval . sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film  and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arraki's wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess . of the tv star cameos  john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist . if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation  it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture . maybe greg arraki doesn't want you to like his characters . maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them . maybe he just wanted to piss me off . if so  he was successful .

"some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others  almost as gifted  have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . as was amply evident after basic instinct  sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . rejecting her natural abilities  she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . gloria is her latest disaster . babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity  and neither should stone reject what she does best . janeane garofalo  for example  is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . gloria  directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes  was not screened in advance for critics  almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened  it is clear why they held it from the press . it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . as the story opens  an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents  a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam )  nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . "" be a man  "" his father lectures him sternly . "" don't trust nobody . not no broads . nobody .

"dream with the fishes ( sony pictures classics - 1997 ) starring david arquette  brad hunt  kathryn erbe  cathy moriarty screenplay by finn taylor produced by johnny wow  mitchell stein directed by finn taylor running time : 97 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . -------------------------------------------------------------it's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film  dream with the fishes  when the plodding  tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . any hopeful expectations  however  are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half . the film's central characters are terry ( david arquette )  a depressed  lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident  and nick ( brad hunt )  a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . nick lives in the apartment building across from terry  who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars  but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge  unconvincingly vowing suicide . nick casually asks for terry's wristwatch  and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . of course  terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects  and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . learning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left )  terry's compassion kicks in  and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies  and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him . this is a promising premise  and mr . taylor's film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point  but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed  mournful character who wants to die  while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits  and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . this is by-the-numbers plotting  buddy movie/road movie redux . however  dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline  but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic  if not likeable . unfortunately  that is not the case here  where both of the film's leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying  giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights  and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . far from a romp  this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt  and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . mr . taylor's dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone  it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as "" you should have asked something more interesting  like 'do you enjoy the pain ? ' - see  that's provocative  leaves room for further questions . "" ) the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene  a session of nude bowling  the policeman joining in on terry and nick's acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between  and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . this occurs particularly often during the film's opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital  i'm realising that this is * intended * to be funny  although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it's painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts  sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick's scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . the entire sequence is  then  clearly an exercise for character exposition  with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . among the cast  coming off best is david arquette  the current master in the portrayal of meek  squirming  stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang's swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . mr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique  where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated  as opposed to a bright  crisp look for the smalltown scenes . the charge of dream with the fishes's protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters  and indeed  in many cases have i been in the minority  supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult  audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . for dream with the fishes  though  i did find myself on the flip side of coin  often hoping that the film would quickly conclude  and that the nick character would just hurry up and die .

"inspector gadget ( pg ) . ( walt disney pictures/buena vista international ) director : david kellogg stars : matthew broderick  rupert everett  joely fisher  michelle trachtenberg  dabney coleman  rene auberjonois  michael g hagerty  voice of don adams . this pedestrian and largely unfunny adaptation of the popular children's cartoon series joins those other woefully miscast  misguided live action adaptations of animated series ( the flintstones  mr magoo ) in the cinematic wasteland . a strangely uncharismatic matthew broderick ( remember his glory days as ferris bueller ? ) steps into the shoes of the robotic sleuth with more gadgets than a hardware store  but he is clearly out of his depth . broderick plays john brown  a security guard who dreams of becoming a police officer in riverton . his wish comes true in a most unexpected way after he is severely injured while attempting to stop a break in at the laboratory where he works . brown becomes the guinea pig in a revolutionary experiment conducted by the beautiful scientist brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) aimed at creating a robotic cop . he ends up looking like a cross between the six million dollar man and robocop  without the inventive genius of either ! gadget's first case involves trying to solve the murder of brenda's father  which brings him up against the villainous industrialist claw ( rupert everett  in a complete contrast to his recent role in an ideal husband  etc )  who creates an evil version of inspector gadget and sets about creating havoc in the city . the less than cluey inspector gadget gets plenty of help from his inquisitive and intelligent niece penny ( michelle trachtenberg  from harriet the spy ) and her dog brains . david kellogg's direction is ham fisted and unsubtle  and the film has plenty of flat moments  especially for older audiences or those who fondly remember the '80's cartoon with some affection . the special effects are occasionally quite good  but more often than not they are distinctly second rate and unconvincing . the performances are suitably camp and unconvincing . everett hams it up nicely as the arch villain of the piece  and almost steals the movie . some of the film's best lines belong to the gadgetmobile  the wise cracking  talking car with attitude  whose antics will probably delight younger audiences . don adams  who provided the voice of gadget in the original series  gets a brief cameo here providing the voice of brains  the dog  in some nonsense during the final credits . admittedly  inspector gadget is comic book stuff  but still some effort should have been made to accommodate those audiences older than eight years old who will inevitably be dragged into the cinemas . the biggest problem lies with the uneven script  which can't seem to make up its mind whether it should be over the top comic book fantasy or not . there are a few clever in-jokes throughout the film ( such as the godzilla send up ) that provide a few chuckles . unfortunately  the best and most inspired moments come too late  during the final credits . sadly this disappointing film is a case of no go gadget !

"the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film "" the world is not enough "" is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming "" james bond will return . "" oh i certainly hope not . with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007  "" the world is not enough "" is the best example to date that "" 'enough "" is enough . in this  the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming's debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred  the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups  stunts  and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original . we've got previously-used speedboat chases  ski chases  and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines . we've got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them . we've got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction ( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean  lean panache ) . and  as has been the case since 1977's "" the spy who loved me  "" we've got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr . fleming . we've also got a main title song by garbage to which  with very little effort  you can fit the lyrics to * both * songs from "" tomorrow never dies .

"" in addition  michael apted ( yes  the respected director of such films as "" coal miner's daughter  "" "" nell  "" and the "" 28up "" documentary series ) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clichés . you get the "" talking killer "" plot device--you know the scenario : the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age . and you get a slew of high-priced assassins who can't hit a barn door at 20 paces : in the film's opening minutes ( of an endless 128 )  bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leather-clad lovely fails to hit bond's souped-up "" fishing boat "" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her . later  she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out . these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles  vodka  or credit cards . in and among the rampant product placements  brosnan grapples with carlyle  "" braveheart "" 's sophie marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she's terrible )  "" wild things "" ' denise richards ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she's laughable )  and judi dench as m . dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self-respect ( about the time roger moore inherited bond's walther ppk ) . brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you'd expect of the former "" remington steele "" star  but even he has to be thinking there's more to life than an easy paycheck . he's given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver  but only one of them-- "" i don't know any doctor jokes "" --made me chuckle ( although "" i thought christmas only comes once a year "" is more in keeping with the series' penchant for grown-worthy puns ) .

"filmcritic . com presents a review from staff member bradley null . you can find the review with full credits at http : //www . filmcritic . com/misc/emporium . nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/2806678910bd05a588256896002ac2e9 ? opendocument if you've ever found yourself in a theater watching a movie like throw momma from the train or don't tell mom the babysitter's dead  then you'll understand my experience with drowning mona . drowning mona is one of those films that you might hear about and shrug it off as a bad idea . then you'll see a trailer and realize that your first instinct was right . there is no logical reason for you to ever see this movie . it looks unfunny  moronic  and you have already crossed it off the list of all the movies you are potentially interested in ever investing your time in . but despite all of that  you somehow end up forking over eight bucks for the privilege to see it . and your worst fears are realized . suffice it to say that drowning mona is a bad film . it is a very bad film . let us count the ways . first  there is the plot . everybody hates mona . mona gets killed . and the question is not who did it  but who didn't do it . as far as this plot goes  let me just ask  can anybody think of a good whodunit black comedy ? hell  the trouble with harry was alfred hitchcock's worst movie . i'll even go so far as to say that it's simply not wise to attempt to conjure any sort of comedy out of movies about mean and/or dead women . anyone who has seen either of the two movies cited above should understand this concern . in the particular case of mona  it seems to be an important element of the plot and theme of the movie that nobody seems to care who killed mona . they are just glad that she is dead . well  i ask  if nobody in the movie cares  then why the hell would we ? the second problem with the film is the characters and the acting . the actors were actually the reason i talked myself into seeing this film in the first place . i mean sure  danny devito and bette midler have a tendency to not discriminate when it comes to scripts . and they also have a tendency to sink to the level of their material . but here we had jamie lee curtis  william fichtner  casey affleck  and will ferrell  all actors whom i before had thought either had some talent or were at the very least a little funny . but none of them pulled it off here . affleck particularly  who was hilarious in good will hunting  turns in a conspicuously morose performance as the good kid that turns into the prime suspect . fichtner has the sole funny line in the script . ferrell  as the funeral home director  trying to pull off yet another variation of his saturday night live stock character ( half shifty  half outright weird )  just can't seem to suck enough out of the script to generate a single laugh . the third problem with the film is the theme  otherwise known as the point . to put it bluntly  this movie has no point . so just in case your best judgment has left you and you find yourself standing at the ticket booth . maybe everything else is sold out . maybe you feel a sudden compulsion to experience the entire oeuvre of bette midler . maybe you're just not thinking . please  do not see this movie . if movies like this perform poorly enough at the box office  maybe we won't be subjected to any more of them . that's my public service announcement for the month . black comedy is hard . only the select few  like the coen brothers or stanley kubrick seem to be able to pull it off . please note that none of them had anything to do with this film .

"starring : stephen baldwin  chris penn  gina gershon  michael mcgloneunfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . there's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys  the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . bo dietl ( pronounced deedle  baldwin ) is one tough cop  a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . on top of that problem  he has a drunk  gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . then  throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . but right in the middle of the film  they throw in a completely un-related plot point . dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . once the case is solved  the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . baldwin  though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec  does a fine job as one tough cop . penn  who also slips into an impression of his brother sean  is even better as a loser tough guy cop . what one tough cop lacks is originality . this film offers nothing new . nothing that you can't get from any cop film . it screams sidney lumet all over the place  perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman  producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . too much else is lacking . i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture  something that i almost never notice . but once i saw that  i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . at times  i was hoping to see it . one tough cop isn't laughable  nor is it a terrible film  but it just isn't unique . it is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . but one thing is for sure  it could really use a better title .

"director : jon turtletaub cast : anthony hopkins  cuba gooding jr .  donald sutherland  maura tierney  george dzundza screenplay : gerald di pego ( based on the novel by daniel quinn ) producers : barbara boyle  michael taylor runtime : us distribution : buena vista pictures rated r : violence copyright 1999 nathaniel r . atchesonyou know  i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . while watching instinct  i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . even beside the tarzan comparison  instinct just isn't a very good film . it's painfully idealistic  manipulative  and silly . i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore  most of the acting is quite good . but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct  and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . things start off in the predictable way  as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero  theo caulder ( cuba gooding  jr . )  an ambitious  young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced  old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life  the one he thinks will make him famous . the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins )  an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa  and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial . through a series of short sessions  caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . even though it really is an old man version of tarzan  much of this central idea is rather interesting . as i said  hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting  that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . gooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins  playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . the screenplay  written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn  gives us no background information on caulder  but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work ) . nonetheless  these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . unfortunately  filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure  for they work together to make the dumbest  most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live  and they do so by means of brainless subplots . first  we have the prison warden subplot . the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case  then that's fine . there's also the prison guard subplot . the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision  and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . then there's the daughter subplot  in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all  she is the daughter of a deranged man . if some of this stuff sounds familiar  that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had . ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption . hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . and then there's the whole tarzan thing  which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are "" takers  "" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . i can sympathize with that  but only when it's in a compelling film . this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates  in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor  we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise  then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors .

"the farrelly brothers' third film  after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 )  brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon  some nasty humour  a cute dog  and a mix of love  fate and romance . plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom . unfortunately for ted  he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) caught in his zipper  and misses the big night . thirteen years later  ted still can't get mary out of his mind  and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her . once found  it turns out that mary has more than one suitor  and that's when the real fun begins . critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes  some funny looking people  and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep . having said that  i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one  but that is saying a lot  since i really did love those earlier pics . this one is also quite funny  but it didn't really blow me away like the others . then again  maybe my expectations were too high . then again  maybe i should shut up  and write a little more about the film  and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film . continuing where their other pictures left off  the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities  and a simple plot by which to tie them all together . this one also includes plenty of toilet humour  but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged . i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not . not a good place to be . having said that  the scenes that did tear through the audience  and yours truly  were extremely hilarious  and went on for several minutes after the punchline . the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) . on the negative end  i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture . i found them quite useless  unfunny and distracting . also  i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer . and of course  i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful  intelligent  single women still can't seem to find the "" right guy "" ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) . i did really like all of the actors in the film  especially ben stiller  who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996  flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) . i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth  and lee evans with his superb faux-sympathy british accent . funny stuff . also  make sure that you stay for the credits  because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip-synched version of "" build me up buttercup ""  which is really cool . overall  a cute comedy with a decent premise  and a few particularly hilarious scenes . little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script "" dust to dust "" into the hands of eddie murphy via  murphy's neighbour . they only found out about murphy's interest  when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night . matt dillon is a high school dropout . in between acting gigs  dillon has branched out into the restaurant business . close to home in his native new york  he co-owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls . cameron diaz stands 5 "" 9  started working as a model at the early age of 16  and loves cats . ben stiller's father is jerry stiller . he played george costanza's ( jason alexander ) father on tv's "" seinfeld "" . peter farrelly has written a novel entitled "" outside providence "" which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin . rob moran  who plays the cop in this film  also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin  and the bartender in dumb and dumber . he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college  and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor/correspondant julie moran . harland williams  who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film  also played a state trooper in the farrelly's earlier dumb and dumber  and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man .

"more movie views by jamey hughton at : http : //welcome . to/movieviewsthe thomas crown affair  a remake of the 1968 steve mcqueen romance of the same name  is a glossy star vehicle with an attractive surface but an empty shell . while you will probably enjoy the star chemistry  the film lacks a certain urgency . and those expecting present 007 pierce brosnan to be dodging explosions and attempting death-defying stunts should look elsewhere . this remake follows a more laid-back and conventional pace  but it still can be fun . brosnan plays a wealthy art lover named thomas crown who steals expensive paintings because  well  he likes to . his latest heist has aroused some suspicion . after an ingeniously crafted caper in a museum involving a group of hired goons and a decoy helicopter  the insurance company sends in a representative by the name of catherine banning ( rene russo ) to investigate . banning  with a striking fashion sense and a very floppy hairdo  manages to piece together the heist in a few brief moments of scanning the video surveillance . but the identity of the ( very bright ) burglar is still unanswered . working with detective michael mccann ( denis leary )  banning works fast . she attends a party uninvited  wearing a very revealing dress  and gets to know mr . crown a little better . she knows this debonair businessman is the thief  but she can't find the evidence to prove it . the chemistry between brosnan and russo in this film is not a noticeable strong point . they work well enough on an individual basis  but don't create enough believable sparks together to make their relationship click properly . pierce brosnan perhaps wasn't the best actor to take over for steve mcqueen  because he's lacking more than a few striking attributes that the latter was known for . but his performance is slick enough to hide these drawbacks . russo's role  also maybe better suited to a different actress  is still the stronger one . she has never looked better . perhaps casting wasn't the most persuasive part of the thomas crown affair  but the actors are in top form . the 2nd act of this film struggles valiantly to hold the viewer's attention . the director is john mctiernan  who is far more accustomed to helming big-budget action films ( he was behind the camera for die hard and predator ) . perhaps it's his direction  but most of the thomas crown affair feels somewhat stiff . the actors and scenery are pretty  the set-up is well staged  but there is little push behind the initial story . everything seems to meander along slowly until the last fifteen minutes  which contain just enough clever twists and turns to keep us interested . if there had been more focus on this sneaky little fun  the majority of the plot could have moved smoother ( the opposite goes for entrapment  which was fun and exciting but rarely stopped to establish character details ) . the presence of denis leary as the bickering detective helps . leary is a gifted comic actor who adds some zest to the story  although i did want more from his character . there's also faye dunaway  the original insurance investigator in the 1968 version  playing crown's psychiatrist and having fun doing so . inserting dunaway in more than just a brief cameo appearance was another wise move . little additions like this one can prove very effective when carefully scattered throughout a movie . an action film this ain't . the thomas crown affair is more like a long-shot romance with a detailed back story to support it . it has a tendency to be very entertaining  but the lack of a real 2nd act nearly sinks it . the actors are charming  but can't scrounge up enough sparks to keep the momentum flowing . this film has a great opening  a memorable finale  but what's left in-between leaves something to be desired .

"in zoolander  the world's most successful  influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders  "" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? "" obviously  the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? no  of course not  and it never aspires to be anything more . much like derek  zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy  and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles  wild characters and performances  and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . better yet  this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia  since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . enter derek  whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . on the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor )  and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . much like the austin powers films  zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved  and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . wilson is hysterical as the young  vain hansel . ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant  freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . jerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein . even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged  large-assed masseuse . as for ben stiller  it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid  which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . unfortunately  taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . maybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies )  making her unbelievable as a dowdy  brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years . she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo  who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role . while zoolander is hardly highbrow  its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times  especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . zoolander's no masterpiece  but a very worthy distraction .

"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue  we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way  like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion )  some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . until that happens  1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed  when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel  materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . one of such movies  one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen  is william friedkin's to live and die in l . a . the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film  it is the major elements of the plot . rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps  and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career  masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent  adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . however  his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . finally he sets up a final sting  but his superiors deny him the necessary money . being frustrated  and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow )  he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent  but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . like french connection  one of his previous masterpieces  this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life . gerrald petievich  author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay  spent many years working as a secret service agent . that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency  not much utilised by hollywood . secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath  whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary  those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . compared with him  and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action ""  two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . instead of being a classical good guy  secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick  who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . in such surroundings of moral decay  the not so happy  yet surprising ending doesn't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin's directing skills . the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro  dean stockwell  debra feuer  darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . that scene alone  with lot of realism  thrills and surprise twists  is worth seeing the rest of the film . the soundtrack  provided by now almost forgotten band "" wang chung ""  is also one of the more memorable of that decade . in every case  to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it .

"for more reviews and movie trailers  visit http : //www . joblo . com/plot : this movie takes place over one day . it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran . the rookie doesn't know much about "" street justice ""  so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the "" real world "" . how even cops like themselves have to "" bend the rules "" and "" break the law "" every now and then  in order to catch the really bad guys . critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board  some ups  some downs and a thrilling ending  despite a couple of small flaws . i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place . the film gets right into the "" dirty "" side of  well . . . the dirt on the streets  and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us  the audience ) how things really work down there . of course  we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time  but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either . and therein  lies the fun of the film . do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ? well  as the film moves along  we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament  and to me  both sides made sense at some point or another . and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that  the director  who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades . hawke  first off  because he rarely plays these "" commercial "" roles but does so perfectly here  with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top . and denzel  well  what can you say about mr . washington that hasn't already been said before ? he comes through as per his usual high-level style here  and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent  of which  i personally would like to see more . he's nice  he's not so nice  he's smart  he's not so smart  he's caring and he's a dog all the way . the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay  we get it . . . you have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major "" coincidence "" which involved a bathtub  that saved the day for one character  but seemed a little too "" convenient "" for my taste . i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament  only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene . but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama  a film that gets you right into the streets  into the nooks and the crannies  and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts . see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself  see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen  and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie . in fact  see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone . . . dang  now that's intense ! where's joblo coming from ? the corruptor ( 7/10 ) - crimson tide ( 9/10 ) - l . a . confidential ( /10 ) - lethal weapon ( 8/10 ) - requiem for a dream ( 8/10 ) - seven ( 10/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - traffic ( 8/10 )

"director : george armitage cast : john cusack  minnie driver  dan ackroyd and others the nice but somewhat strange martin blank ( john cusack ) has an uncommon profession . his nice clean office with secretary soon turns out to be a flourishing killer agency . but although the hitman business is going well martin has problems . they are of a more personal nature and he regularly stretches out on a therapist's couch to solve them . the therapy comes to an abrupt end when he finds out that all his therapist's book that he admired so much where written by a ghost writer . nevertheless he lets this psychoterrorist who has severe problems himself talk him into attending his high school reunion at grosse pointe  michigan . by doing this he combines business and pleasure for his next contract is taking him there anyway . moreover a visit to his hometown gives him the opportunity to meet his high school sweetheart debi ( minnie driver ) whom he left without saying good-bye ten years ago . unfortunately things don't go according to plan because there's a hitman going after martin as well . the sleepy little town is in for one hell of a ride . john cusack who wasn't able to show his talent in this year's blockbuster 'con air' can do so now . he is very convincing as the troubled killer who justifies his deeds by pointing out that he never kills innocent people . his methods are just as extravagant as his personality . it doesn't always have to be a gun  does it ? the president of paraguay e . g . was killed with a fork . you have to be creative in a job that doesn't require a college degree  much less a ph . d . tom jankewicz seasoned the script with a healthy dose of black humor to prevent it from being just another big gunfight and thus defuses the more brutal scenes . he doesn't quite reach the skillfullness of the coen brothers but the dialogues and the funny situations stop the viewers from thinking about the fact that many people are killed in this movie . e . g . in the scene when martin has to kill one of the hitmen that try to kill him in a corridor of his old high school during the reunion dance . with the help of a friend he wraps the body in a piece of decoration and burns it in the school's furnace . the attentive viewer asks him- or herself where the big bloodstain in the corridor has gone and why there are no other bloody marks . the coens wouldn't have let this happen . on the down side are - once again - the female parts . they remain one-dimensional as usual . here they are secretaries ( joan cusack ) or ex-sweethearts ( minnie driver ) . especially debi's part could have been better . debi who is a dj with her own call-in radio show doesn't hesitate to embarass her former lover in public asking her audience whether she should give him a second chance after ten years . martin watches this in horror and can't believe the punishments the callers suggest . unfortunately that's minnie driver's only good scene . a big plus is dan ackroyd as professional killer grocer whose job it is to kill martin . their exchanges are a joy to watch for every lover of bizarre humor . grosse pointe blank has too many loose ends and boring parts to be a masterpiece  but it makes a nice change to watch it in between blockbusters . sense of ( very ) black humor required .

' her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity ( homosexuals running the streets )  and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life . the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other . there is no ultimate 'answer' or final comprehensive understanding after the month-long vacation . the film is neither here nor there ; it's a neutral  meandering  gentle  portrait of life on both sides . copyright © 1998 by david sunga this review and others like it can be found at the critic zoo : http : //www . criticzoo . com email : zookeeper@criticzoo . com

"if you¹ve been paying attention to the media frenzy that is the blair witch project  and who hasn¹t  you know the story and you know it¹s pure dramatization . needless to say  though  watching what has been committed to tape  one gets the undeniable impression the events are veritable : three students take hand- helds into the woods  filming a school project about the myth of a local witch  and get lost . no biggie  as the put-upon leader of their crew  heather  states rationally  "" it¹s hard to get lost in america  and it¹s harder to stay lost . "" what starts out fun and games  so to speak  amongst friends ( correct "" gilligan¹s island "" vernacular ; heather¹s mishap with a pair of wet shoes ) quickly becomes something more serious . rations dwindle  their only map disappears  and camaraderie gradually disintegrates into bickering  nicotine jonesing and total disorientation . they set up camp  several times too often  and wake up to vague but ominous noises just in the distance . and  that¹s the ingenious thing of the film : the heard  yet unseen  proves to be a lot more terrifying . because  try as you may to put what¹s going on into perspective ( twigs snap . . probably a small animal )  you still don¹t know for certain . and  because there is little light for assistance  you can either stay in one place very quietly and pray  or make a run for it in the pitch black and take your chances . during heather¹s emotionally-draining private confessional for the camera  she sums this experience up quite nicely : "" i¹m afraid to close my eyes  and i¹m afraid to open them . "" what¹s also great about the film is its budget . the point of view footage is antsy  because the actors get antsy and don¹t know exactly where to look or where they¹re going in the heat of apparent pursuit . i think blair witch will play even better on the small screen  because of its aspect ratio and the likelihood of a more quiet environment ; occasionally  i was unable to hear what the actors were hearing due to an audience loud with throat- clearing and squeaky seats  and it bugged me immensely . there is no special effects work  no computer-generated anything  and mostly no gory close-ups ( save for a set of teeth )  which gives the film a great deal of authenticity . and  what i like most is the eerie conclusion ; that last scene  in an abandoned  dilapidated house  is nerve-wracking and more than a little disturbing . the collective opinion circulating the net at present is that this scene is too quick  and the film ends rather abruptly . which is true  but that¹s the point . it is heather¹s fear and despondence  come to the breaking point . after being in the woods for so long  and not knowing what would ultimately happen to them at any given moment ­ whether she  or her friends  would make it ­ she and mike arrive at one last spot  maze-like and frustrating  and in an instant it¹s all over . you leave with questions  and want to talk about what you¹ve just witnessed with as many people as you can get it in a room . movies that can put you there have done their job ; real  or fake ( forget the whole is-it-a-sham-or-not business  already ) . that final image ­ you know the one ­ is cryptic and haunting . i wanted more scenes at night  with ­ not _clearer_ sounds  but i don¹t know  more of them . even greater a building of exhaustion and fear . the film does not quite go the psychological distance  but it¹s close . also  the arguing goes on a little much for my taste ( one fight  over the whereabouts of the map  turns especially shrill )  though such carrying-on is understand- able  circumstances considered . "" scary as hell ""  no . creepy  yes . effective  brilliantly- conceived and executed  and performed with all the conviction in the world so that even if we doubt what we¹re seeing is real  suspension of disbelief is never an issue : _oh yeah_ . best line : 90% improv equals no cleverly constructed dialogue ; i like the reaction heather has to a shot of scotch ( i hate it  too ) .

"director : john sayles || screenplay : john sayles || stars : federico luppi ( dr . fuentes )  damián delgado ( domingo  the soldier )  dan rivera gonzález ( conejo  the boy )  tania cruz ( graciela  the mute girl )  damián alcázar ( padre portillo  the priest )  mandy patinkin ( andrew )  kathryn grody ( harriet )  iguandili lópez ( mother )  nandi luna ramírez ( daughter )  rafael de quevedo ( general ) || mpaa rating : r john sayles' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . the film takes place in an unnamed central american country  where the men with guns are the rulers . most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns  some are controlled by army soldiers with guns  and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves  bandits  and terrorists . all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . however  like so many central american countries  this one also features modernity . there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers  hospitals  televisions  highways  etc . but  it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land  or else they are simply ignorant of it . the film's main character  dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . one of his patients  an army general  describes him as the most educated man he has ever met  and also the most naive . fuentes is a true liberal  a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . with government assistance  he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . this program was to be his legacy  and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . however  when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his protégés  he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . as he travels deeper into the forest  going from village to village  the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers  usually for helping the other . when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors  she replies simply  "" because they had guns  and we didn't . "" rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns  because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey  all of whom are characterized by their loss . first  there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonzález )  who has neither a mother nor a father . next  fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( damián delgado )  who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . through his ordeal in the army  domingo has lost most of his self-respect  and defines himself only by his pistol . along the way  the group also picks up padre portillo ( damián alcázar )  a priest who has lost his faith . as domingo is running from the army  so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer  and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . last  the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz )  who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier  her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in "" men with guns . "" ( like many of his films  sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room  but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) he creates fascinating  complex characters  especially dr . fuentes and domingo . their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is  but later is isn't ) . the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . sayles knows how to bring a location to life  whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in "" matewan "" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in "" lone star "" ( 1996 ) . sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( "" gattaca "" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico  using all latin american actors  and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief  but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . it would not be a stretch to say that "" men with guns "" is a depressing film . in fact  the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . in addition to loss  the main characters are also failures at something  whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine  or padre portillo's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . nevertheless  it is bleak material sayles has chosen  and he deals with it accordingly . the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope  even in a world where  as one character puts it  "" nobody refuses the men with guns .

"starring liam neeson  ewan mcgregor  jake lloyd  natalie portman  samuel l . jackson . rated pg . the event of events is upon us . people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless . it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . but that does not mean that the film itself is bad . in fact  it is terrific . i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation  angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small  peaceful planet of naboo . the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" )  qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur  the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine  where they meet the movie's real focal point  young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . he is an innocent slave boy  but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . as any self-respecting star wars fan should know  anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . around 70% of the characters  if not more  are computer generated in one form or another  and though the effects are seamless  the movie lacks soul . i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade  cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far  with plenty of broad comic relief to go around  much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? "" and "" mesa go now  okeday ? ""  and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh  come on  as if you didn't already know )  among other things  is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" . what made me surrender and give this movie  stars was the score by john williams . even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days  his work here is nothing short of brilliant . his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . when you see "" a long time ago  in a galaxy far  far away ""  when the familiar music plays  when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen  you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin  a boy whose innocence  we know  will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good  but they do not . we not only feel more involved in the story  but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . the phantom menace  although lacking in human aspects of the story  is a very worthy installment in the star wars . it works as an action flick  visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories  a piece of exquisite nostalgia . ©1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; --== sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ ==-- ---share what you know . learn what you don't . ---

"" mamet's timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production . the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score  which is  in fact  a very similar story . both are good films  perhaps for some of the same reasons . but at least on a high level they are much the same story . the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them . i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12  2001 . that made the subject matter just a little too timely . my understanding is that the release will be delayed . my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon's acting at times seems very poor . it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection  as if they are just reading the words for the first time . it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller . it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

"an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80's . sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte  who are on the lookout for love . alice is mousy  shy  intellectual  charlotte is bitchy  out-going and fun . we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures  and men  all to the background of the local disco . whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story . alice and charlotte are both well written characters  and the actresses who play them aren't bad aswell . sevigny delivers an honest performance  and makes the audience feel for her character . beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified  yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable . the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining . the dialogue is sharp and well written  with many funny set pieces . for example  there's a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters . the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun . the direction is good  bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes . but their are slight flaws with the movie . firstly  although it is supposedly set in the 80's  the characters are very  very 90's . the way they dress and act have a very 90's feel to them . although the male hairstyles look slightly 80's  frankly the 80's atmosphere just wasn't conveyed  which is a shame . also  as mentioned above  the film is too long  and some parts do lag . the charm of the characters do help these moments  but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter . the plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust  which seemed out of place in this movie . finally  their are almost too many characters in the film  and despite the running time  the film never really spends enough time on them . some of the characters are very slight  which is a shame . the conclusion  while funny  is also surprisingly weak  and certainly not strong enough . but despite these qualms  the last days of disco is a funny  warm movie  which is certainly worth seeing  and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80's . worth a look .

"director :   steven soderbergh cast :   george clooney  jennifer lopez  ving rhames  dennis farina  don cheadle  albert brooks  steve zahn  catherine keener screenplay :   scott frank producers :   danny devito  michael shamberg  stacey sher runtime :   120 min . us distribution :   universal rated r :   violence  language  sex by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits . i really do like to read  and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . my problem is that i'm a slow reader  and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina  even though i'm loving the book ) . in addition to this  i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting  time after time  that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception  i believe  is great expectations ) . however  i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . needless to say  i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight  on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is  or if it lives up to leonard's vision . i can say that it's a terrific film  with sharp acting  great dialogue  and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters  all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . out of sight proves that it doesn't . i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor  incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . after seeing his latest performance in this film  i've changed my mind -- this guy can act  but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . here  he plays jack foley  a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . he does it because it's fun  i think  but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend  buddy ( ving rhames ) . we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez )  a u . s . marshall who  conveniently  is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . fortunately  they take her hostage  and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another  though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and  since this is a gritty crime comedy  flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . at first  i kind of felt that it was a gimmick  but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction  too . it's a fun gimmick  though  and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex  lies  and videotape )  but i think he's excellent at what he does . he's an artist without making it obvious  and without being pretentious  which is always admirable . he uses tricks  yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here )  but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . as i said  clooney is terrific  and he's matched by lopez . lopez is  of course  beautiful  but she can act  too . i can sense that she's honing in on her skills  for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film  by far  is the seduction scene . the brilliance of this scene is also due  in part  to soderbergh  for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances  layered upon light dialogue  and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . the supporting cast is strong  led by the always-reliable ving rhames . dennis farina  who plays karen's father  is good  as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . steve zahn  who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn  steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . out of sight is certainly a light film  although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . overall  i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . not every film has to change your life  and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . as for the book  this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at .

"ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon  the book of the dead . bruce campbell stars as ash  who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods  and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget  constant location changes  and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star  bruce campbell . campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty  as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead  everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . also  there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . for that scene  it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana  so being the wacky kids that they were at the time  they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before  and as a result they became "" confused "" and were unable to perform the scene . i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . don't get me wrong here  when they do speak it's entertaining to hear  but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask "" have anything to say sam ? "" to me  that's not a good sign . also  it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . . well  compared to rob and bruce anyway . also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's "" gala "" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . overall  the evil dead is a good low budget horror film  superior to many films in it's genre . and the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining . the jacksonville film journal -- film reviews by chuck dowling url : http : //users . southeast . net/~chuckd21/ email : chuckd21@leading . net © 1999 of the jacksonville film journal . no reviews may be reprinted without permission .

"if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland  you're going to love the hunt for red october . you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics  or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan  or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films  die hard and predator . in fact  the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book  since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them . the hunt for red october is an epic thriller  adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel . set in an era before glasnost  the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine  called the red october . the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system  which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection . the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius  played by sean connery . ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine  but he has other ideas . he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean . is he planning to start world war iii ? cia analyst jack ryan doesn't think so ; he's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan  played by alec baldwin  is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub . the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin  but the performances  thankfully  are rock solid . baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor . sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery's somber first officer . it's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians  since they are both best known for their roles as british agents  connery as james bond and neil as reilly  "" ace of spies . "" the large cast also includes scott glenn  james earl jones  tim curry  and joss ackland  plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser . the special effects are remarkable  but more than anything  the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot . screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns . they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment . the movie doesn't get as sweaty or breathless as die hard  because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action . the finale is rousing and suspenseful  but essentially  the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler .

"release date : january 22  1999 starring : emily watson  rachel griffiths  david morrissey  james frain  charles dance  celia imrie directed by : anand tucker distributed by : october films mpaa rating : r ( language  sexuality ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/hilary . htm not since 1996's shine  which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott  has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . in fact  if one were to watch these films together  it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . yet hilary and jackie  the sophomore effort from director anand tucker  has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale  playing the sisters du pré . both musicians from childhood  hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women  both together and seperate . their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's  and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . they contrast each other wonderfully  and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pré is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic  both characters are charged with emotion . the frank cottrell boyce script  which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pré  brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . the script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature . cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least  and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . nevertheless  hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around .

"" high art  "" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized  but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere  while syd's luck begins to rise . the film in no way is about lesbianism  but about love  which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together  we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other  even if the relationship might be doomed . with this picture  ally sheedy's star has risen once again  thanks to her touching  nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy  a woman who  in the course of a decade  has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs  which has taken away her once-blossoming career . her characted really is tragic  and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother  in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem  and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can't help her  is heartbreaking . although not autobiographical  sheedy has had drug problems in her past  and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy's footsteps to her role . also very good is radha mitchell as syd  who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy  "" love and other catastrophes  "" wh caught me by surprise with her performance . easily being able to pass as christina ricci's older sister  mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . as accurate as almost every detail is in  "" high art  "" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james  who  played by gabriel mann  is left with a throwaway role . by the time he finds out about syd and lucy  he disappears from the film  and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . this is a very minor fault  however  in a film that is full of riches . although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair  syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . the character of dominique ( anh duong )  the "" frame "" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas  was also written to be far more mature than expected . and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . for once  it did not invlove steaminess  or violent sexual activity  or gratuitous nudity  but focused on the actual characters  who love each other  and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex .

"dawson's creek resident hunk james van der beek goes from playing a sensitive school kid tackling some of life's riddles on the small screen to a sensitive kid tackling some of life's ironies on the big screen in his first major feature film role . on the surface varsity blues is another movie about football and the pressures of competing . however  director brian robbins ( good burger  etc ) and writer w peter iliff ( patriot games  point break  etc ) give the film a more human aspect that will appeal to those not normally attracted towards sports oriented movies . varsity blues also deals with teenage angst  the problems of parental expectations  and the decisions they are often forced to make that will shape their lives forever . everything in the small texan town of west canaan revolves around the local high school team . disillusioned fathers live vicariously through their son's achievements on the football field  while the whole town basks in the glory of their triumphs . even the town sheriff overlooks many of their high-spirited pranks . however  for jon moxon ( van der beek )  football has lost that element of pure fun that he and his team mates enjoyed as children . he doesn't buy into the football as a metaphor for life angle espoused by ruthless coach bud kimble ( jon voight ) . kimble is a legend in the town for his on field success  although that has come at a high price . mox believes that there is life beyond football  and that winning is not everything . of course  mox's indifference towards football brings him into conflict with the arrogant kimble . we don't learn much about kimble's personal life  as we only see him in his office  cluttered with trophies  and on the field . then we realise  somewhat sadly  that  for him  football and coaching is his life . while reluctantly warming the bench awaiting his chance to play  he reads kurt vonnegut . kimble's star players are forced to use pain killing injections to prolong their time of the field . after lance breaks a leg after a fierce tackle  mox is promoted to quarterback  and becomes the new star of the team . at first  he has trouble coping with the instant fame and adulation  and loses direction for a while . his new found fame also threatens his relationship with julie ( amy smart )  who doesn't like football jocks . eventually  mox manages to put everything back into perspective and attempts to remain true to his own values . varsity blues has plenty of bone crunching football action  but it is mox's off field struggle with some of life's complex questions that will sustain the interest . the hunky van der beek will obviously be one of the main attractions for audiences . however  veteran voight weighs in with another intense  oily performance as the obsessed and driven coach  and brings some bite to the clichéd part . relative newcomers scott caan and paul walker are also solid as two of mox's team mates . ron lester ( from good burger ) brings a poignant touch to his role as the overweight but genial giant billy bob . varsity blues is a strong and unusually sophisticated film for adolescents that delivers some important messages . it also proves that teen movies are capable of more than just ribald comedies and slasher flicks .

"`blue streak'  martin lawrence's newest outing and first appearance without a big name star by his side ( life  bad boys )  may be cliched and formulaic  but it entertains  none the less . however  be warned that if you're not a martin lawrence fan you should stay far away from this film  as it is carried almost entirely by his comic antics . the story opens with a gang of high-tech thieves led by miles logan breaking into what appears to be a jewelry store . the robbery has just been completed  when one of the gang pulls a double cross and accidentally alerts the police . miles manages to secure the stolen gem in an air duct of an uncompleted building before the police catch him . two years later  released from prison  miles goes back to recover his prize only to discover that the building is now a police station . what is the most obvious solution ? why  to disguise himself as a cop and join the ranks of course . as a by-the-numbers piece of film making  it is fairly easy to guess the outcome of this movie from the start  though i won't reveal it here . in fact  the only things that truly make this worth seeing are the performances by martin lawrence and luke wilson as his likable  yet incredibly naive partner . lawrence's talent stems mainly from his exaggerated speech and facial expressions  and he puts this talent to good use here . just watch his expressions in a scene in which a dozen or so cops have cornered him and are asking what his opinion is about some new piece of police equipment . unfortunately  there are some rather large problems with this movie in addition to the predictable script . first  there are several utterly pointless characters such as melissa green  a defense attorney who appears in only three or four scenes  and is apparently present only so the audience can dislike her . the film's largest annoyance comes from tulley  who is a friend of logan's from the jewel heist . chappelle has such a whiny  obnoxious voice that i saw several people in the audience cringing whenever he spoke . despite these problems  the movie is a lot of fun  and lawrence is clearly having the time of his life making it . i simply hope that next time he finds a more original script to house his rather considerable comic talent . for delivering a lot of chuckles and a few belly laughs  i give `blue streak' three and a half stars and a recommendation to try and catch a matinee . * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made  see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie  hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you've got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain . e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com

"now that "" boogie nights "" has made disco respectable again ( well  fashionable at least )  we shouldn't be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman's "" the last days of disco . "" stillman  who made "" metropolitan "" and "" barcelona "" using some of the same actors  uses disco's final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . the young  upwardly-mobile professional ( don't call them yuppies ! ) men and women of "" the last days of disco "" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire  amy grant  and andrea true connection . here they talk and talk and talk  intellectualizing about such things as dating  success  and being liked  accepted  and admired . if talk is cheap  "" the last days of disco "" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie  harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit  perception  and style ( including  at one point  a riotously inventive deconstruction of "" the lady and the tramp "" ) . naïve alice ( chloë sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . charlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted  "" like a kindergarten teacher . "" the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot  looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . here they meet  or re-meet  a variety of eligible men  many of whom they knew in college . des ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club's managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . des has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday  in fact--that he's gay . whether it's true or not  it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . jimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who  by the end of the picture  winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of "" barcelona "" ? ) . josh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say  just once  "" book this clown ! "" and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice's revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . in fact  the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . while the eschewing of "" ferocious pairing "" is a favored topic of conversation in the film  the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love  lust  and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the "" preferred "" dynamics of social group interaction . more mature than stillman's previous two films  "" the last days of disco "" is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . it's a movie you should definitely get on down to .

"warning : if you actually wish to see the film  stop reading this and see it . while i don't blow any plot details  the more you know about a movie  the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) . but  in a nutshell  it's a good film . never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation )  it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment  the phantom menace . however  it can't be ignored . endless toys lining the shelves  endless news reports  and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult . with the level of this hype  one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998  godzilla  which definitely failed to live up to expectations . thankfully  the phantom menace does much  much better . while the "" first "" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker  the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) . without blowing too much of the story  the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo  which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation  and it's up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji  played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi  played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it . the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics  leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat . common complaints range from lack of characterization  weak narrative  poor direction of actors  the dated style  and too much focus over special effects . still  film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism  much of which the average film buff does not care for . hence  this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the "" improvements "" in the special editions ) . there are many memorable sequences throughout the film  ranging from the fast and furious "" pod race "" sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in "" ben hur "" ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids . utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before  special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail . no matter how many times you watch this film  you will catch something new . the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well  mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks  who belongs to a race known as the gungans . best described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo  he steals the show . unfortunately  being that he is a computer-generated character  tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective  as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) . with star wars mania at an all time high  there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts )  which this film does have a tendency to do at times . there are a few logic problems with the plot  several things are left unchecked  and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) . that  and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character  coming off as a smarmy  arrogant brat ( with such an attitude  it's no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) . still  it seems that many people  especially critics  are missing the point . the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you'll blow in your life  which is something i wouldn't mind doing again . while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender  who really cares ? the film is pure fun from beginning to end . and isn't that what really matters ?

"the sixth sense  -a review by bill chambers ( 6sense@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring bruce willis  haley joel osment  toni collette  olivia williams written and directed by m . night shyamalan you've seen this moment before  recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting  we don't care . the hero of the sixth sense  a young boy named cole  is a rich creation  and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . the seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . desperate to get his career back on track  even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams  of rushmore )  malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm  in a spine-tingling scene  that he sees dead people walking among us  all the time . malcolm assumes  and given his profession  reasonably so  that cole is schizophrenic  not psychic  but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . he will instead pursue the supernatural angle  becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother  lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . ( though shyamalan does  somewhat unforgiveably  crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) it's far more heartwarming than frightening  and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown  but they're not out to harm him  really-they just want to be heard  even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us  at first  than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . that's right : willis  for the first time in years  gives up the spotlight to his costar . we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma  but we identify with cole  recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . both actors deliver immensely likable performances  and their dynamic is manifest . willis convinces us that he's a doctor  something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . osment is phenomenal  a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer  tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky  effective ad campaign is misleading . only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather  feel-the movie's running time  which is just shy of two hours . the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . i'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof  but i admired its audacity .

"my filmcritic . com colleague norm schrager nailed session 9  brad anderson's throwback to spooky horror films from the 70's . it worked as an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern . genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick's the shining and george romero's dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i . e .  a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues ) . in a double-whammy for 2001  anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes from the twilight zone  appropriately titled happy accidents . much like session 9  the cards are played very close to the vest here . is boyish  eccentric "" sam deed from dubuque  iowa "" a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run-of-the-mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present-day streets of nyc ? as played by wonderful character actor vincent d'onofrio ( full metal jacket )  it's up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted . the question proves to be moot  at least for a time . even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion  one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend  ruby ( marisa tomei ) : "" he's a freak  but he sure tells a good story ! "" neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie  the fetishist  the artist  the frenchman  etc . )  but isn't quite sure how to handle "" sam deed "" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm  his elaborately constructed fake identity  his pathological fear of dogs  his ability to speak five different languages  and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities . ( don't ask . ) it's all a bit much to take in . ruby's close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can't have a love story without the token friend  though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game  but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her head with yet another doomed relationship . who ya gonna believe ? despite her winning an academy award  marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence  one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents . her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear "" cute "" to her adoring fans . being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal "" substantial and sexy . "" it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality . then there's that damned voice  which strains to be oh-so-adorable . look  this stuff is purely subjective . some people feel this way about richard gere  others cannot bear to watch robin williams' hyperactive schtick . for my money  it's m . tomei with a bullet . happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or  more appropriately  chris marker's la jetee  especially with those still framed "" memory "" photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout ) . modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly  vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan's run . as the stranger in a strange land  d'onofrio walks slightly out-of-step  wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment . this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds  not words ! ) at least twenty minutes too long  happy accidents eventually gets around to a race-against-time scenario that puts "" sam deed "" to the ultimate test . no movie can live in ambiguity forever  but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . ( let's pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened  shall we ? ) there are also some slow  repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he's crazy . the premise is strong enough to sustain interest  but it's enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half-hour time slots  commercials included .

"rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odeon ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by entertainment distribution on april 21  2000 ; certificate 18 ; 101 minutes ; countries of origin canada/usa ; aspect ratio 2 . 35 : 1 directed by mary harron ; produced by chris hanley  edward r . pressman  christian halsley solomon . written by mary harron  guinevere turner ; based on the novel by bret easton ellis . photographed by andrjez sekula ; edited by andrew marcus . patrick bateman is someone tom wolfe might have come up with if he had written his books on acid . he's an arrogant suit from wall street obsessed with physical fitness  facial care products  designer clothing and expensive restaurants . and scoring cocaine . and misogyny . oh  and he likes to mutilate people  and play around with their guts  too . the character is the creation of bret easton ellis  whose 1991 novel "" american psycho "" was set amid the manhattan yuppie scene of the late 1980s . the book was twisted  but it needed to be  because it had extreme things to say . ellis saw the widespread obsessive egoism and greed of the me decade as dangerously sick  and his vision of its potential to produce vicious murderers makes a fair amount of sense . after all  any idiotic businessmen who made enough bucks could follow their every impulse and shit on whomever they wanted to  and their attitude was championed as fashionable . now "" american psycho "" is a film directed by mary harron  with christian bale in the lead role . as in the source material  bateman divides his time between working out  making lunch appointments  sitting around in his office and butchering fellow new yorkers . onscreen we see him stabbing a homeless man and a female acquaintance  decapitating a hooker with a chainsaw  blowing up a crowd of cops  chopping up one of his colleagues with an axe and telling us about numerous other crimes . even when a private detective ( willem dafoe ) starts investigating the disappearances  though  bateman never comes close to being caught . why would anyone suspect a 'normal'  standard  efficient young capitalist earner of criminal activity ? the killings in the story hammer home in a jarring manner the message of how inhuman bateman and his ilk are ; although his chums don't kill people or know that he's doing so  they do share his level of detachment from decent values . most of the film illustrates this through black humour . in one scene  for example  a group of men use their business cards for a vanity contest  comparing them like cowboys showing off the sizes of their guns . the problem with the comedy in the film is that harron doesn't trust the material to be intrinsically funny  and has her actors deliver lines in broad  goofy tones  making clear they're in on the joke . that doesn't prevent us from laughing  but it does affect the satirical power of many moments -- we giggle mainly because the characters are talking in a preposterous manner  rather than because they're saying preposterous things . since almost every scene is performed in this silly way  the film is nowhere near as intense as the novel . if we laugh at the characters' paper-thin morals  that's the extent of our reaction ; harron doesn't let us give them enough thought to also be appalled by them . you could take the murders out of her "" american psycho "" and it would be the same movie -- its purpose is to merely point at the vacant pomposity of the male yuppie  and ridicule it . still  on that level the movie works well . although it is a missed opportunity ( ellis's angry expression of the madness of the situation was more affecting )  it is at least an entertaining deflation of white-collar stuffed shirts  and those guys can be the most despicable of people . i see them all the time in bars and restaurants  thinking their suits make them mature  arrogantly raising their voices  telling stupid childish jokes to each other  rambling in stockbroker jargon that they think impresses onlookers . and now  whenever that happens  i can smile to myself that someone else in the vicinity will have probably seen this movie  and will be laughing inside at what morons it shows them to be . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit  and encourage others to visit  the uk critic's website  which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic

"vampire films  as well as other horror films  are usually dumb and predictable b-movies  meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks . it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning  but has also a plot worth making movies about . based on anne rice's novel  "" interview with a vampire "" is a long  dark trip to hell . the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco . the camera slowly find particular window . a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness . "" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? "" . the mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt )  a two-century old vampire  telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater ) . his tale opens in 1791 louisiana  just south of new orleans  where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise ) . given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead  louis chooses the latter  a decision he will forever regret . everlasting life and eternal youth  promised to him by lestat  turn instead into never ending suffering  damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace . louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat  but  to sate his hunger  he must feed  and the blood of animals is not enough . eventually  he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst )  whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis . for a while  they are one "" big  happy family . "" but all things end  and claudia's growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation . when luis and claudia break loose from lestat  they travel to paris  where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas )  who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned . director neil jordan ( "" the crying game "" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere . as the film begins  there is an incredible palette of colors  beautiful sunrises  lush golden fields  green forests  inky-blue clouds and blending sun . when luis is "" born to darkness ""  everything suddenly changes to dark velvet  lit only by the silver moonlight . the beautiful production design by dante ferretti  wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film . from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century  to our present days . the casting is likewise good  involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood  ireland and spain . the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective . cruise is energetic  sinister  charismatic  wild and bloodthirsty . cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance . with alarming swiftness  the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror  as his murderous purpose becomes clear . "" . . . kill them mercifully  but do it . you are what you are . . for do not doubt  you are a killer ! "" that is how lestat is teaching luis . but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages . brad pitt is equally convincing as the "" vampire with a human soul "" . antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective  but since they play more or less secondary characters  their performances are almost invisible . the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst  who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character . the world is changing around the little child  but she does not . she remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity . only her wise  dark eyes reveal her age . ironically the film's only miss is the script . anne rice's novel is a very interesting read  and her script is rich  colorful and emotional  but it is also tiering and too melancholic  at times resembling a soap opera : claudia : "" . . . . is that what i should do ? let you go . . my father  my luis  who made me . . . who will look after me  my dark angel  when you are gone ? "" luis : "" everything will be alright . . "" claudia : "" do you really believe that ? "" and then they hug emotionally . moments like those displayed above and luis' self-pity is a bit tiresome . however rice's script is otherwise strong and well structured  bringing up humor and comic episodes  that were more or less hidden in the book . when lestat finds claudia's dead dressmaker  whom she has killed  he cries out : "" who will make you that dress now ? be a little practical . . . . never in the house ! "" moments like that are both entertaining and appealing . neil jordan's direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity  homosexuality  love and loneliness . his gothic saga is not meant to scare  but to display these issues differently . wrapped up in mystery  his new  original picture brings vampire-films to a new height .

"it's an interesting premise . our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . in truth  our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . what we see  what we do  everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . our bodies  severely atrophied  are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network  a sham world  the ability to plug one's brain into a computer  has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator  dark city  and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo  who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . the group's leader  morpheus ( laurence fishburne )  has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . from the beginning of the film  we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . this  in a lesser movie would be annoying  but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . what is reality ? what is a sham ? the film turns our very perception of life on its side . more than once  we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality  or live a life of relative bliss  oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . as viewers  this is intriguing enough  so imagine what it would be like for neo . and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? reeves  whom i've never really cared for as an actor  is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness  and little subtlety . he was good in speed  for example  but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely  so much of my expectation was happily for naught . in a couple of places  the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature  and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . i mean  since bill and ted's excellent adventure  what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? more interesting than reeves is fishburne  who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions  and convincingly so . very surprising for a sci-fi movie . fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout  as if he always knows what to expect . this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge . hugo weaving as agent smith  one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs  is also good playing his deadpan  no-nonsense  kick ass role  which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . unfortunately  when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row  the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . carrie-anne moss plays trinity  morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . although her character is somewhat inconsistent  moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture . there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . many methods of imagery are employed  from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen  turned  then continued from a new angle . this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle  with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . the motion cameras film the action  and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . pretty slick . the matrix drips with style . from the clothing to the music to the action  we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to . much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu  there's a lot of gunplay . when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon  much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados )  especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . combined  it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen . the film is not without its faults . some of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films  and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance  a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying  and it wasn't meant to be a joke . however  these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .

"every year around this time  or during the christmas season  the walt disney studios unleashes one of its treasures on the general public . the motivations behind this  no doubt  are to introduce an animated classic to today's younger audience  an audience very different from that when the film was originally released . last year  audiences were treated to the lady and the tramp . this year  it's the turn of peter pan  a somewhat cruder film than that canine love story  but one which manages to mix enough elements to keep the young in years -- as well as the young of spirit -- happily entertained even after they leave they theater . based on james m . barrie's beloved novel  peter pan is a familiar coming-of-age tale to most people  made all the more so by the recent rebroadcast of the 1960s television special starring mary martin . this animated version is probably the only time peter pan has actually been "" played "" by a boy . even though the film is under 90 minutes long  it does tend to get a little draggy towards to the end . this is due in part to the fact that  about two thirds of the way through  the film peaks  only to peak again not long afterwards . captain hook battles peter pan ( and that infernal ticking crocodile ) and it wouldn't be giving anything away to say that the good guy triumphs . they could have ended the film right there . instead  hook makes off with wendy which sets up the second climax . it's confusing for the younger set and repetitious for the older ones . one cannot easily think about peter pan and not the songs which accompany it . for example "" i won't grow up "" and "" never smile at a crocodile . "" in this animated version  the former is never heard and the latter only appears in an instrumental form backing the toothy protagonist's occasional appearances . it's hard not to notice the backgrounds in the film . these  such as the pirate ship  skull rock and scenes of london  are exquisitely detailed . the characters themselves seem somewhat flat in comparison  often lacking in detail . they register emotion more by a widening of the eyes than any kind of body language . but the film really takes off when it shows us glimpses of these children's world from an airborne point of view . the scene where the children fly over to london  following the second star on the right  is quite breathtaking  much like those imax films about flight they show at the national air and space museum in washington . and shots of never-never land  also from the air  are quite magical . one  of captain hook and first mate smee in a boat with captive indian tiger lilly  is so beautifully animated that the water looks real . disney has always been able to convincingly bring water to life in all his movies -- remember the storm in bambi or the subterranean sequences in pinocchio ? if you can ignore some of the film's minor flaws  you should have a ripe old time at the movies . thirty-six years after it was made  peter pan still makes for a wonderfully colorful entertainment . | produced by : walt disney david n . butterworth - university of pa | | rating ( l . maltin ) : internet : butterworth@a1 . mscf . upenn . edu |

"this remake of "" la cage aux folles "" features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son's future in-laws . the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal  or as the less kind might put it  stereotypical  gays possible . williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star . they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode . williams is excellent as should be no surprise . gene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles . the real star is lane . his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious . perhaps it is a personal failing on my part  but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it . luckily ( for me at least )  it doesn't last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men  their son and the deception . the question of stereotypes is a touchy one . these guys personify the homophobic gay image . you can almost hear the swishing . if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world  you'll be outraged . but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals  you'll love it . your choice .

"originally launched in 1978  this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers . based on the mighty successful musical from broadway  grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 )  starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles . plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia . the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song  dance and humour . critique : fun-loving  energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler . this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's  with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers . admittedly  i am somewhat biased in this opinion  since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences  and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection )  and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time . but apart from the nostalgic vibe  i was still extremely impressed by this film  as it continued to amuse me  despite my previous dozen or so viewings . this film took john travolta from a dim-witted "" sweathog "" on tv's welcome back kotter  and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) . unfortunately for the rest of the cast  his popularity was not terribly contagious  despite their effective showings in this classic movie . on the down side  some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about "" drinking lemonade "" and "" staying out until 10 "" with danny in "" summer nights "" )  and the plot isn't exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created  but despite these small reservations  this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) . make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player  as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film's absolute highlights . and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards  so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you're feeling a little blue . little known facts : henry winkler  of tv's happy days' fonzie fame  turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career . both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture . conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest  and married newton-john's sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) . visit joblo's movie reviews  "" http : //www . microtec . net/~drsuess/

"i love japanese anime on the big screen . the gorgeous colors  the daunting cel animation detailing the smallest blades of grass  the complex storylines and character designs  and the thundering soundtrack . and the impending release of vampire hunter d : bloodlust has made me wet with anticipation . the original vampire hunter d was produced for video only in 1985 . its twisted violence  a plot thick with deception and honor  perverted sex scenes  and beautiful acts of heads and limbs being lopped off are a d&d geek's wet dream . based upon volume three of hideyuki kikuchi's vampire hunter d novel series  bloodlust follows the continuing story of d and his travels as a vampire hunter for hire . in the distant future  vampires rule with an iron first over fiefdoms of human-occupied lands with their minions of mutants and werewolves . as the years have passed  though  the vampire rulers have gradually lost their power and are now being hunted by bounty hunters . one of the most famous hunters is a mysterious outcast named d  a "" dunpeal "" ( born of a vampire father and a human mother )  who's equipped with a super-quick sword  a black cape blowing in the wind  and a penchant for ass kicking . d's latest job involves a simple rescue operation to reclaim an affluent family's lovely daughter charlotte from the clutches of meier link  an ultra-smooth vampire with a silly eurotrash accent . but competition waits in the form of the markus brothers -- a randy bunch of mercenaries who use knives  strength  crossbows  and even a guy's ghost to capture their vampire booty . along the way  the undead rise from their graves  werewolves howl at the moon  and creeping evil in the shadows crosses their paths at every turn . vampire hunter d : bloodlust is a qualified success in the animation department  combining fantasy with reality through the solid efforts of asian production house madhouse studios ( also responsible for co-creating the awesome hbo spawn animated series ) . but there's a strong western influence in both set design and landscapes throughout the picture . as well  director yoshiaki kawajiri ( wicked city ) handles the action well and delivers a number of memorable moments that even rival anime classics like battle angel . on the flip side  the main problems with the film are that its plot is weak and the characters fail to evolve . bloodlust never sells the conviction of evil within any of the main characters  instead relying on the age-old romanticism of the vampire . eventually it degenerates into a standard love story/rescue mission . worse still  d's character is so utterly invincible there's never a sense that the story could go any other way than that he will save the girl and beat the evil bad guys . the film's humor  mainly projected by d's talking left hand  feels forced and unsure . vampire hunter d : bloodlust earns enough points in the animation department to carry the innocuous plot . it's almost enough to make you forgive the lousy title .

"director : michael winterbottom writer : hossein amini ( based on the novel "" jude the obscure "" by thomas hardy ) starring : christopher eccleston  kate winslet  liam cunningham  rachel griffiths  june whittfield  ross curvin turnball  james daley no  i did not read the novel by thomas hardy  "" jude the obscure  "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . but  after watching the movie  i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system  but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is . the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure )  but its story could even be retold today in modern form  although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) . it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple  dim-witted young man with big dreams . in its bleak  foreboding opening  shot in grainy black and white  he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham )  his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain  looking upon a city in the distance  he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common  he moves away to a town with a giant university  with a chance to learn more  and get ahead in life . taking a welding job  he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars  reciting latin over and over again  and training himself . but when he sends his application for the school in  he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet )  his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends  so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school )  there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . several twists turn in the storyline  and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene  to say the least . . . )  and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock  as she eventually gives birth to their baby  and jude inherits his son from arabella  who turns up again after awhile . because they aren't married  and because they're cousins  they run into problems with every place they go to  carrying around two children everywhere  and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time  then moving on . if you didn't think this was harsh enough  wait till you see what happens later on . . . the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . he will never gain any true happiness  and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting  and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic  and too gullible . but society has a way of taking these people  and hurting them until their death . the ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . "" jude "" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties  but shows no way of curing this  and thank heavens it doesn't . there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society  and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds  and that's what "" jude "" is . sure  it's one hell of a downer  but it needs to be . the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads  and some good supporting work along with it . christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully  sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face  and making him kind of child-like at other times . kate winslet  in a pre- "" titanic "" performance  is brilliant  nailing every psyche of her character  and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality . kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me  see "" titanic  "" branagh's "" hamlet  "" "" sense and sensibility  "" and "" heavenly creatures  "" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . in the supporting roles  liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher  exposing all his bad parts  but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife  whom he never divorces . "" jude "" moves at a very slow pace  and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists  which would drive some people nuts . but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films  no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate "" jude  "" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .

"director : todd haynes writer : todd haynes ( story by james lyons and haynes ) starring : jonathan rhys meyers  ewan mcgregor  toni collette  christian bale  eddie izzard  emily woof  michael feast it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship  a green ovular pin  and the birth of oscar wilde  but if one really strains  they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature  and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned  loosing his family and his career . the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality )  they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine  "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement  not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it  steals a lot from "" citizen kane  "" and that's true . in the film  a british journalist in the 80s  arthur stuart ( christian bale )  is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade  a fictitious rock star  who faked his own death on stage  bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . structure-wise  this totally steals from "" kane  "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people  and the story is a result of their flashbacks )  but in other things  like the beginning ( death  then newsreel )  and smaller details  like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer  found in a bar after hours . this is no "" kane  "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did  and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity . instead  it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy  equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . but the 70s scenes are engaging  though  not to mention addictively campy . they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era  and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage  they become not only a symbol of decadence  but of times when everything seemed so simple . instead of creating the world the way it was  haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it  everything else seems so mundane . there's no outside world to speak of  secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero  curt wild  and their relationship that created  molded  and then brought down the movement  reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop  respectively  complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music  but also partners in bed . through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast )  ex-wife mandy ( toni collette  reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade )  and finally ex-partner wild  journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era  like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity  including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record  he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket )  and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene  finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur  molding scenes that are like long heald breaths  such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover  "" baby's on fire  "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence  the first concert scene of wild with his band  the ratttz  where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent  and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . even the brief music videos  spoofs of bowie's  have a rare visual flair that's pure camp  and which would cause ken russell to drool . the best sequence  though  may be the beginning  following the prelude  a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . in it  stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death  where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination  which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background  the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on  and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending  and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show  docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair  depressingly staring into the mirror  it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . this movie's not so much about plot  but more about the way it is presented  making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance  "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . however  for the most part  the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world  by using his sets  costumes  cinematography  and especially the music to play as characters in his film . the music is especially notable . the soundtrack  which is wall to wall  consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno  t-rex  and roxy music  as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke  and occasionally rhys meyers himself )  and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . the cast is rather impressive  but no one really walks away with the film  and no performances are extremely good . although eddie izzard  as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly  and collette and mcgregor have their moments  rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par  neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era  dying when he turned into a retro-garbo  resorting to a life of salinger-ism  and found in the mid-70s to be lying around  sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . in fact  no one in this film is really seen as a person  rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood  he's not an extremely personal character  and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him . nevertheless  rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them  and others  bitter  part of which helps the film work  since this is a major piece of eye candy . at the prime of the movie  they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing  androgonys persona  and wild with his topless and unpredictable image  which clash and fuse into an unstable union . their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging  without the personal background . the story of stuart  though  is a tougher sell because he's the everyman  and when you can't totally identify with the everyman  your story's in slight trouble . as a cultural rock piece  "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good  but it is merely good . it never totally takes off  although it has moments where it absolutely flies  but then comes back down . it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments  surrounded by material that could really be much better . the beginning is captivating but slow  the middle is fantastic  and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that  it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion  it could probably stop at any point ) . and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past  which is commendable but not totally so . still  it does what the oliver stone pic "" the doors "" didn't do right  becoming very insightful to what happened  using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : "" live life  but after you've lived it  what else is the point when you'll be forced to live with regretful memories ? "" ) . the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks  it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era  but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down .

" cast : matthew modine ( private joker )  adam baldwin ( animal mother )  vincent d'onofrio ( private leonard 'gomer pyle' )  r . lee ermey ( sgt . hartman )  dorian harewood ( eightball )  arliss howard ( cowboy ) director : stanley kubrick certification : r ( usa ) for language and violence year of production : 1987 academy award nominations : best adapted screenplay ( kubrick  michael herr  and gustav hasford ) full metal jacket  very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war  is an shocking  emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america . this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker  played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war . however  full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp . these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film  even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning . as in platoon  full metal jacket gets off to a quick start . the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits  which is getting their heads shaved . from there  they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman  played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey . apparently  the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies  because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations . private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant  as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio )  whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt . hartman . the film is continually narrated by private joker  in which he explains his visions on what is going on . the entire corps  although repeatedly hammered by sgt . hartman  continues on . private pyle  however  seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor . he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation  and it basically does not stop . that is  until sgt . hartman comes up with a new plan . he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups  even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can . pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits  and things take a turn for the worst . pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally  physically  and mentally cut out for the life of a marine . after graduation  joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war  which is his service . he is not a member of the infantry  and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat . when he sets out on a documenting mission  this question becomes very clear from the start . joker joins up with a platoon  along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard )  and follows their everyday actions  interviewing and filmming them along the way . he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight  or die . again  as in the tradition of vietnam war films  full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not . a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide . full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam  as have others in the past . this film  in different ways  also can be viewed as more powerful than others . that  again  is up for debate and depends on your opinion . one thing is for sure  however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to . unfortunately  many did .  * david landers - dml@gwis . com - http : //www . gwis . com/~dml/ *

"starring sidney poitier  rod steiger  warren oates  lee grant  scott wilson  larry gates  and james paterson . as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell  there is a wonderful  eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . to see these bars blocking his face  we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots  no matter how innocent tibbs is  he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is  instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . "" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . preceding the very original "" a soldier's story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane  "" "" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . the film  which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs  played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains  tibbs is the perfect protagonist . poitier also gives an excellent  noteworthy voice to his character . never nervous and always commanding  his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . however  unlike "" the hurricane "" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast  poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger  who won best actor for his excellent performance . as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him  steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . he would refer to tibbs as "" boy "" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . as the film progresses though  there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . instead  it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . "" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's . it displays this perfectly . however  the actual investigation  although it is not the main focus of the film  lacks interest . it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . also  it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does  but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967  "" in the heat of the night "" and the even better "" in cold blood . "" )

"jackie brown ( miramax - 1997 ) starring pam grier  samuel l . jackson  robert forster  bridget fonda  michael keaton  robert de niro  michael bowen  chris tucker screenplay by quentin tarantino  based on the novel rum punch by elmore leonard produced by lawrence bender directed by quentin tarantino running time : 155 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction  the cinematic output from its creator  quentin tarantino  has been surprisingly low . oh  he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit  taking small roles in various films  overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn  making cameo appearances on television shows  providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything  it seems  except direct another feature-length film . it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film  jackie brown  one of the most anticipated films of the year  and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . she's 44 years old  stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16  000 a year  plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson )  who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . the loquacious ordell  based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny  bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out  operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat  and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . meanwhile  the authorities' target is ordell  and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . only through a series of clever twists  turns  and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" )  there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense  the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . in terms of ambiance  the film harkens back to the 1970s  from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax  funky music blaring away on the speakers  is emblematic of films of that era . the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995  but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course  nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads  and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists  backstabbing  and deceptions deliciously unfold  the strength of jackie brown is the quiet  understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss  it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure  there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer  or even in reservoir dogs  where a deep  unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part  mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy  unexpected outbursts of violence  and clever  often wordy  banter . these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown  but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent  and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick  hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes  and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary  sensitive  and exceedingly-professional max cherry  whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . mr . forster's nuanced  understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie  we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead  with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . as it turns out  ms . grier is solid in the film's title role  although nothing here forces her to test her range . i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection  though -- she's been working steadily over the years  often in direct-to-video action flicks  but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course  it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress  let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone  it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding  and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes  it's filled with such sumptuous riches  ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining  inconsequential conversations between the characters  that there wasn't an unengaging moment . with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt  it'll be interesting to see what he tries next .

"writer/director : john maybury starring : derek jacobi  daniel craig  anne lambton  tilda swinton  adrian scarborough  karl johnson  annabel brooks  richard newbould "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film  munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot  perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline . watching it  i was enthralled with the look of the film  the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre  personalized filter . everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon  the film's subject  looked at it personally . but while i was engrossed  i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film  awakened from my trance by some inner distraction  and began to try and follow what's going on . exactly what was i looking at ? watching this film  i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . directed ( and written ) by john maybury  "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . the camera angles are ferociously askew  and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . the editing is deft  occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds  but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs  or rather  intruders to bacon's world and psyche . as such  there is no real story . i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film  but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s  drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . he was one of the first to really come out of the closet  and in interviews  he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi  he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . he lives life the way he wants to live it  to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends  and pain for my sham friends  "" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life . bacon  well-known in his mid-life  awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . he walks in  unafraid of what he finds  and discovers a thief  george dyer ( daniel craig ) . bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him  he can take anything he wants in the morning . george agrees to this  and off to bed he goes  but ends up staying with him  for whatever reason . the film shows their lives together  at least in reference to one another . while creating bacon's world of friends ( like "" high art  "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood )  the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least  especially not his paintings . while watching this  that's basically all i thought was there . the film has a hypnotic feel  free of any restraints of form  and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . once the film is over  it's easier to piece it together . i kept on thinking about this film  wondering what the point to all of it was . someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all  and if they do  they do it by accident  but still allow some substance to creep in . thinking about it  i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . i thought about how bacon was a masochist  in love with cruelty ( in one scene  he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight  and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene  he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's "" battleship potemkin "" )  and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . he drove him over the edge  and for him that was love  even if it wasn't for george . i guess that explains the title . a bit . that's great and all  but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity  about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is  if you look at it a certain way ) . or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche . it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat . that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not . i can't say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil  "" though . despite all of the things i respect about this movie  it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through . even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes  the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through  especially after an exhausting first hour . though hypnotic  it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times  as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . as such  i respect the way the film looks . it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that  along with "" what dreams may come "" and "" dark city  "" it's the year's most visually stunning film . in fact  if a better script had been forged  i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film  complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi  it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . then i would have had something to hold me over even now .

"disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure  mulan . while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect  it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . fa mulan ( ming-na wen  singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it's just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles )  mulan would prefer speaking her mind . but there is trouble on the horizon . the evil huns  led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer )  are invading china . the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . the only male in mulan's family is her father  fa zhou ( soon-tek oh )  who  old and with a bad leg  honorably accepts his fate . mulan  on the other hand  decides to save her father's life . . . by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . mulan  under the assumed name of ping  appears at camp where she  along with the other bumbling recruits  yao ( harvey fierstein )  chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe )  are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . wong  singing : donny osmond ) . but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in typical disney fashion  she has three animal companions : her horse khan  a lucky cricket crickey  and a pint-sized "" guardian "" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame  the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story . sure  some occasional comic relief is welcome  particularly in a film geared for the younger set  but mulan overdoes it . the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good  but schizophrenic experience . but  that commentary aside  this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . the animation is on par with some of disney's best . the story itself is interesting  and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . the musical score to the film is enjoyable  though  as has been the case with disney's recent work  the songs are mostly forgettable . at least  we're only subjected to four of them this time around . mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) . there's nothing graphic  and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor  ax the compulsory songs  and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance  they could have had a classic on their hands . instead  they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .

"david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head . it is one of many science fiction films  released during the last year of this millenium  that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . the story unfolds in a near future  where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . the world of the future is an unfriendly place  where the scared inhabitants are "" hiding "" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world . allegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh )  the leading game designer in the world  is testing her new virtual reality game  existenz with a focus group . as they begin  she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun . she flees with a young marketing trainee  ted pikul ( jude law )  who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard . unfortunately  her pod  an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program  is damaged . to inspect it  she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her . the events leading up to this  and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist  as the "" players "" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot . here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective . i don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise  which is structured as a computer game  with "" tasks "" that the characters must complete to win the game . released after "" the matrix "" and "" dark city ""  "" existenz "" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films . however  "" existenz "" is moving in a different direction  with a premise of its own . a combination of dazzling special effects  brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot  made "" the matrix "" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience  with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . "" existenz "" has a completely different atmosphere  resembling "" dark city ""  which is darker  more serious and less entertaining . "" existenz "" has the opportunities and potential  but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . after the engaging beginning  it starts to falter . while i was watching the film  many left the theatre during the first hour . and indeed  "" existenz "" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal  the plot and dialogue silly  unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another . but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level  explaining all past events  the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes . and jet the film fails on several issues . probably the best written character in the story is a game designer  who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world  than face real life . this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character  and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg's script to the limits  but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown . existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies . it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for . it's a cold  dark place where the "" players "" are forced to interrelate with unreal characters  eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will . it doesn't look like a place worth even thinking about . david cronenberg has been the creator of "" the fly ""  "" videodrome "" and "" the dead zone ""  so it's not so hard to guess that "" existenz "" is a violent and gory film . besides the regular murders of innocent people  the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium . scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can't make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures . the way i see it  this is the film's crucial failure . it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time  space and problems of our everyday life do not exist ; a place of blooming blossoms  green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . because of its lack of three dimensionality  the film looses most of its possibilities  but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes  amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought  depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . during the film  the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . "" the matrix ""  despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts  ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . "" existenz "" does not . it is a one time experience  ending in blood  gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow .

"this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday . jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin . as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him . he has become an unquestioning weapon . he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . but even assassins have innocent pasts . he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school . complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin . calder is a familiar actor in britain  though not frequently seen in the us . he was seen in the world is not enough . here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years . he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake . his lair is underground  apparently in a sewer  where he lives like the king of sewer rats . it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet's life . paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair  he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness . by using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world . this is a world that is cold and unfriendly . sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see . this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach . we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that . the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross  but it is sarossy's film all the way . it creates indelible images of evil . i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 3 on the -4 to + 4 scale . ( i do hope they do not use the tagline "" don't mess with mr . in-between . "" )

"as with his other stateside releases  jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle  mr . nice guy  is contrived  blockheaded  and lacking in narrative logic . but also like those other films  it is a highly enjoyable ride . once again  chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie  with no last name . this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . of course  jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist  and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . other plot details  involving a videotape and a biker gang  are irrelevant ; in fact  as is the case with most chan films  the plot itself is just about irrelevant . the sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes  and those here do not disappoint . director samo hung ( who has a cameo role )  a longtime collaborator of chan's  does not waste any time putting chan in action  diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . other impressive set pieces follow  most notably a chase in a mall  which directly leads to some frenzied  if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? )  business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site  in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards  cement mixers  and a deadly buzzsaw . none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor  respectively . but the action delivers  even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale  as spectacular as it is  is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . filmed almost entirely in english ( even so  the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed )  mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour  a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown  and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy  for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands  much like they have been before .

"" good will hunting "" exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling  but  unlike "" little man tate "" or "" phenomenon ""  it doesn't set up its story in a black and white  point a to point b be manner  but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy  familiar choices  like the protagonists in the aforementioned .

"director : jean-pierre jeunet writer : joss whedon starring : sigourney weaver  winona ryder  ron perlman  dominique pinon  michael wincott  dan hedaya  j . e . freeman  brad dourif  raymond cruz  kim flowers  gary dourdan  leland orser i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga  so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . of course  that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something  because "" alien : resurrection  "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film  much like the first two were . however  it's a very good film which never fails to entertain  and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . in short  i had a good time . "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one  where our heroine protagonist  ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver )  the science fiction genre's answer to job  had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body  waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . of course  the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it  though not as much as the first two )  and more importantly  it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . so back we are  with ripley back as a clone  which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing  but it's becoming a cliche ) . so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy  dr . wren  played by j . e . freeman  as well as the little-seen dr . gediman  played by none other than brad douriff )  mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one )  the film's okay . also on board are a band of mercenary pirates  including michael wincott  ron perlman  kim flowers  raymond cruz  dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder  who plays analee call  who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it  but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years  you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) . there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley  but it's never really deepened enough . oh well . well  as you might have guessed  the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya  for instance  who's death is comical yet sad since  well  he's dan hedaya )  and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . of course  the plot is all balderdash  and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun . the real focus of the series seems to be on style  not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it  most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . "" aliens "" is a wild  tense thriller . "" alien 3 "" is a bleak  moody piece of semi-noir . "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film  filled with lots of humor  and cool scares . jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner  marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has  with echoes hinting at a possible threat . the chills in the film are really cool  especially with the music  which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning ) . and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . one is the aforementioned surgery scene . another one takes place between call and ripley  which is just awesome . the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense  thrilling  and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film  "" delicatessen "" ) . and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) . but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) . it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work  as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . however  it does make us care about most of them  so that when there's very little of them  and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow  we are pretty scared . and  yeah  there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! "" johner : "" well  i can get you off . but not this ship . "" ) the acting is good all around  with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner  and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . winona ryder is good  but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . of course  and as usual  sigourney weaver steals the show . playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional  and more rude and bitter )  she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens  "" but she's just awesome . overall  it's a thrilling  entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two  but is much more amazing than the third installment . the style is the best part of the film  which isn't really a bad thing  but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . but it's entertaining as hell  and it's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series .

"richard linklater's "" slacker  "" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23  000  immerses itself in the twentysomething  college-town culture of austin  texas . most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy  the pervasiveness of slave morality  the subtle messages in pop culture  and such . ask them what they've been doing lately  and they'll more likely than not reply  "" oh  you know  just hanging out . "" linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes  then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person  who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . . . . it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas  some of them are just plain weird  and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . the opening monologue  delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver  tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy  while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in "" scooby-doo . "" for the most part  however  the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . near the beginning  a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks  warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . another man seems to be collecting televisions  keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film  a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . the only problem with "" slacker "" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character  the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . there are only so many times you can hear  "" hey  what's going on ? "" "" not much  what are you up to ? "" "" nothing really  just hanging around  "" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff  for example  seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist  and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first  linklater shows us the oddballs first  then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . "" slacker "" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy  whatever its flaws  and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . i just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order .

"director : marshall herskovitz || screenplay : jeannine dominy ( based on the book "" the honest courtesan "" by margaret rosenthal ) || stars : catherine mccormack ( veronica franco )  rufus sewell ( marco venier )  jacqueline bisset ( paola franco )  oliver platt ( maffio venier )  moira kelly ( beatrice venier )  fred ward ( domenico venier )  naomi watts ( guila de lezze )  jeroen krabbé ( pietro venier )  joanna cassidy ( laura venier )  daniel lapaine ( serafino franco )  jake weber ( king henry ) || mpaa rating : r || review : eauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . it is beautifully filmed  wonderfully acted  and certainly nothing short of entertaining  but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . dealing with themes of forbidden love  religious intolerance  subordination of women  sexual freedom  and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society  it still feels like brightly lit fluff . the director  marshall herskovitz  doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down  so he opts for a more genial  livelier  and relatively shallow interpretation . the film takes place during the renaissance  a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . at this time  venice was its own republic  and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice  so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . however  there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes  their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack )  a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell )  the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabbé and joanna cassidy ) . unfortunately  the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather  it was more like a business transaction  where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power  wealth  and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in . veronica  despite her charm and good looks  is certainly an outsider . after a short love affair  marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . however  because she is beautiful and intelligent  veronica has a chance to enter marco's world  albeit not as his wife . she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing  and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society  and they were greatly revered  respected  and often envied . at one point  a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother  paola ( jacqueline bisset )  who was once a famed courtesan herself . once she enters the lifestyle  veronica finds that it suits her quite well . she is allowed to read all the books she wants  she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry  and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet  including the awestruck marco . their relationship develops into a playful bantering  with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances . in many ways  their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love  and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . "" love the love  not the man  "" as her mother told her . "" dangerous beauty  "" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal  flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt )  her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks  and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in "" braveheart "" ( 1995 )  mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent  witty  and both sensual and vulnerable  all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . the rest of the roles are also filled well  including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "" dark city "" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta  and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin  although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . platt is a good actor  but he's just too hard to hate . jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was  and even fred ward turns up in a small  but moving performance as marco's uncle . "" dangerous beauty "" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort  after the overlooked 1993 film "" jack the bear . "" partnered with edward zwick  herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( "" thirtysomething  "" "" my so-called life "" ) and in the movies ( "" legends of the fall "" ) . his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story  yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . he could have approached the film in any number of ways  including overdosing on the sexual aspect  which he wisely avoids . "" dangerous beauty "" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic  but not so much that it seems exploitative . herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew  including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli  whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller "" kalifornia "" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film "" body snatchers "" ( 1994 ) . bazelli captures the film in strong  bold colors  and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide  panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . however  the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( "" brazil  "" "" the princess bride "" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( "" the age of innocence "" ) . the only problem with "" dangerous beauty "" is that it doesn't stick with you . it's a good story well-told with interesting characters  but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater . the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions  but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional . herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter  but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion  and like the rest of the film  it carries no real weight  despite the potential severity of the subject matter .

"" according to director proyas  probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . it's designed so that you can watch the film over again  and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . it's a philosophical piece . cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons  giant bugs  or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . but science fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the big questions  questions like who are we ? what is the human condition ? what is ethical ? what would a true human being do ? far from comic book style on the order of spawn  batman  or the mutant ninja turtles  dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens  but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . a little more than 200 years ago  the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian  military  conformist  medieval regimes . the people took refuge in religion  the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering  but after death  heaven would be available . meanwhile  the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . when science finally overturned religion  the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud  kant  kafka  nietzsche  and dostoevsky pondered what society should be  and what place the individual had in it . the existentialists' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile  indifferent  or alienated universe . in dark city  when the last dying  defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed  murdoch replies  pointing to his head  "" because the human condition isn't located in here .

"mulan ( walt disney pictures - 1998 ) voices by ming-na wen  eddie murphy  b . d . wong  harvey fierstein screenplay by rita hsiao  christopher sanders  philip lazebnik  raymond singer  eugenia bostwick-singer produced by pam coats directed by barry cook & tony bancroft running time : 88 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- east meets west in mulan  the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films . an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities  this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years  but falls short of actualizing its potential . though not for lack of trying . in many respects  mulan is among disney's most mature efforts  skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village  neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll  is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars  and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy  bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film  long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent  dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? in an instant  idealistic mulan's innocence is lost  and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . the film  based upon an ancient chinese fable  centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones  replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth  although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades  disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere  story intact  to some neutral territory  and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work  there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout  and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary  and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately  it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land . at its core  the film is a tale of heroic adventure  and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour  perseverance  nobility and courage . as such  animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic  where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action  such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice  are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments  particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour . it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick  the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . off to battle  mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little "" lucky "" cricket  who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . they're affable presences  and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited  and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama  the effect is mildly jarring and  from a storytelling perspective  questionable in its necessity . at training camp  mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown  the skinny clown  and the big clown )  who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness  and  in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns  she grows a certain fondness for a handsome  square-jawed young captain  shang . everybody needs love  even ancient chinese warrior princesses  but not necessarily in * this * film . the romantic angle  which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings  lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . another staple of recent disney animated films  a cache of hummable little ditties  has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . composed by matthew wilder  none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing  and one -- "" i'll make a man out of you "" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . only "" reflections ""  an early ballad of lament  proves to be a song of any consequence  serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga  one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices . nonetheless  mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory  with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film  they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . briskly paced with a smart  energetic heroine and filled with high adventure  the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .

"oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . at the same time he creates a very human character  a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics  which is here pictured as a wild animal . he is simply trying to tame it . but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them . stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon . he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself  the system that  once set in motion  behaves with a mindlessness of its own . "" nixon "" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film  there is no gloating  but a watery sigh  as of a great ship sinking . sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding  creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president . joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette . she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . the rest of the cast is equally magnificent  including : james woods  j . t . walsh  paul sorvino  ed harris and bob hoskins . everyone does a serious and demanding job  no one are disappointing . stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy  honest and determined . he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood . the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin  robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .

"in _daylight_  sylvester stallone breaks no new ground  cinematically speaking  but he covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday  as i was going about my business in the university bookstore  i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . i had never heard of the movie  so i stopped by to check it out . it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . so  i shrugged  thought  "" hey  they probably won't give me the card anyway  and i could always use a free movie  "" so i signed up . all in all  i don't think i got that bad of a deal  either . rob cohen  who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and  more recently  _dragonheart_ ( gee  i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? you think ? )  now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture  with fx by industrial light and magic  about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . sylvester stallone plays kit latura  who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . when the crisis hits  he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_  too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain  where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature . in fact  had the two movies been made in hong kong  this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors . the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup . subplots are woven  and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young  frustrated  jilted  rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . and then  thirty minutes into the film  _boom_ . and it's a big one . from there on in  it's sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does  enduring batterings  beatings  falls  repeated immersion in 34-degree water  explosions  mud  rats  and constant setbacks  before going on to save the day  sly-style . again . . . there's nothing new here . and yet there doesn't need to be . the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution . the special-effects are first-rate  thanks to industrial light and magic  and the ensemble cast works well together . once the film hits its stride  it carries the viewer right along to the finish  with very few jars along the way . this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e . meadows . permission granted for distribution through rec . arts . movies . reviews and all associated archival . permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached . all other rights reserved to the author . -- chris meadows aka | author  team m . e . c . h . a .  crapshoot & co . robotech@jurai . net | with a world wide web homepage located at robotech@eyrie . org | http : //www . jurai . net/~robotech/index . html

"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? you remember  he was the title character in that 70's sitcom  "" welcome back kotter . "" always trying to help out the sweathogs  frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman  ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole . "" so  "" you ask  "" where is he now ? "" mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker . that's right . i'm not sure if it's his main source of income  but from what i've heard  the guy occasionally comes away with $20  000 at a time . and there you were  thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . you silly goose . well  gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders  nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life . but rounders is about poker  and gabe plays poker  and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . sorry about the segue  or lack thereof . matt damon plays mike mcdermott  a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . he's been playing for a while  and more than being proficient  he has caught the bug . he goes to all the underground games in new york city  knows the regulars  and knows how to win . in the beginning of the film  he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg  which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play . mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich )  an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker  but instead he loses it all in a single hand . months later  he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students  he wants to pick up right were they left off  working as a team to part others with their betting cash . although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student  jo ( gretchen mol )  worm connives mike into playing once more  and mike  bitten again by the bug  slides down that slippery slope  risking his relationship  education  and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . to make a film about gambling  a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . rounders  however  seems to go more for the latter than the former . the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all . there's a basement  a lodge with elk heads on the wall  a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city  the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations  and good actors to play them . matt damon is very natural as mike  who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school  and answering what may be his true calling  playing professional poker . ed norton's worm is truly a worm  always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth . john turturro  who amazes me with his acting range  tones it down in this film by playing joey knish  a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . he's both a friend and mentor to mike  and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing  just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors  abe petrovsky . while landau slips well into the role  his character  spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self  facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent  however  is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen . she's a genuine peach to look at  kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world )  but her delivered lines seemed very flat  and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead . a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor . the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going  such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next  in widely different locales . one game in a cigar club had me in stitches . "" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper  "" says one of the players  clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . with all the poker being played  rounders had the potential to be very confusing . you might think you know a lot about poker  but think again . luckily  we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on . the narrations are more informative than intrusive  and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . it's nice that as the characters develop  so does our comprehension of their world . as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker  rounders delivers in spades . wait ! as a film about the culture of cards  rounders is an ace . hang on ! packed with great acting and great characters  rounders is a full house . okay  i guess that's enough . oh  by the way  if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan  be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother .

"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review  not because of their own complexity  but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . one of such masterpieces is casablanca  probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art  but definitely the most popular one . its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere  but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail  at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein  philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice  and  finally  man behind camera  michael curtiz was considered to be capable  but not great director . however  the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars ""  including the one for the best film . until this very day  it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda  yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . in december 1941  casablanca  exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral  yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america  and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . many shady characters thrive on their misery  including the corrupt police chief  captain renault ( rains ) . his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart )  who used to be idealistic anti-fascist  and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody "" . however  everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid )  czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman )  with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . the couple needs visas  especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . rick is now forced to choose between love  wounded pride  self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart  most legendary actor in the history of cinema  is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man  torn between idealistic past and bitter present  was so perfect  that his icon would forever be connected with that character . another icon in his company is ingrid bergman  great actress of old hollywood  here in her artistic and visual prime . the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . for many people  casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough  and often wrong choices in their life . the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . the supporting actors also did a marvellous job . sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . unfortunately  the charisma that burdened laszlo  leaves little place for difficult choice  making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . however  rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . captain renault  brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime  was embodiment of perfect  almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie  rains managed to make renault sympathetic character  and his final conversion to the side of good  symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . rains also gave another dimension to the movie  making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick  and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . together with well-drawn characters and exciting story  the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies  but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable  if not realistic . any way  even if we don't see it as a historical document  casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration .

"pleasantville  it was once said that ignorance is bliss . but how can you know bliss while ignorant ? if you know not sorrow  you know not happiness  and vice versa . such is the story of pleasantville  a movie that's  quite frankly  inspired . the story of a 1950's town who's long lasting ignorance is challenged by modern day pop culture . the result of society's ultimate reaction to change . in today's world  we treat life loosely  with little value . many consider material things to be more valuable than long term happiness  and simply obtain them to fill such holes of loss and greed . others search for a happier time and place  and secretly hope for a return to our past . a time many call safer  better  more compassionate . two such examples are modern day teens david ( tobey maguire ) and jen ( reese witherspoon ) . while david regularly drowns out his chaotic reality by immersing himself in reruns of the 1950's sit-com  pleasantville  sister jen lusts after cute boys as an admitted slut  climbing the social ladder through sex appeal . but  as jen prepares for a date with mtv  and david for his much anticipated pleasantville marathon  a doorbell is rung . a strange  unrequested tv repairman ( don knotts ) gives them a remote to replace their recently shattered one  after quickly quizzing david as to his knowledge of pleasantville . after his departure  the two teens quarrel in an effort to win the remote . during the fight  a button is pushed  and the two are transported into the very fictional  very colorless world of pleasantville . david  realizing that if they wish to get out soon they can't tinker with the mindset of pleasant-folk  urges jen to do the same  and play along . while she starts out well  she quickly loses her balance  creating a domino effect of immense proportions  after introducing the element of sex to the quirky little town . soon  the black and white universe begins to sprout color . among the newly enlightened  the perfect pleasantville mother  betty ( joan allen ) . but  it's not just about sex . color can appear as a result of love  compassion  anger  or hate . it is about individuality  the free agency to choose between what is right and what is wrong  rather than stay confined to a "" normal "" and supposedly perfect world . we cannot become perfect by force  but must be allowed to make mistakes  and strive to ascertain it through correction and discipline . one of the film's few missteps hits when it fails to actively portray some of the unfavorable consequences that can result from such promiscuous behavior  as our society learned quickly after the sexual revolution of the 1960's . though it maintains the absurdity of racism  another immorality . and while  throughout the film  director gary ross may trip a bit with his "" hang on a sec while i beat you over the head with my message so hard you won't soon forget it "" strategy  such as the inclusion of signs stating "" no coloreds ""  it does work  something that is a credit to his history as a screenwriter . he's also assembled a very capable cast  including supporting actors jeff daniels ( dumb & dumber )  william h . macy ( fargo )  and the late j . t . walsh ( breakdown  jfk )  as well as the two leads and allen ( face/off ) . the cornerstone of the movie  the gradual inclusion of color as the town progresses  also has a wide range of integrity  and is constructed with great subtlety and detail . it alone is a good reason to see the film . the bottom line is that pleasantville is a fantastic vision of our society as its progressed  and while many may still hope and remember the "" good old days ""  we always must focus ahead on what will be  not what could've been .

"with stars like sigourney weaver ( "" alien "" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano  raising arizona  etc . ) together in a single hollywood production  one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . sadly for copycat  though tightly scripted and nicely plot  is still at heart  a typical hollywood thriller . helen ( weaver )  after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer  darryl ( harry connick jr . )  has developed a phobia for being outdoors  so to speak . incidentally  helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers  which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney )  baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer  seeks the professional help of helen  who  as expected was reluctant at first . copycat "" borrows "" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases  it did work . but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability  this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . even so  weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short  tough  texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . harry connick jr .  a very good jazz singer  shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . copycat is a good thriller . although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show  copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats  in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .

"release date : september 25  1998 starring : robert de niro  jean reno  jonathan pryce  natascha mcelhone  stellan skarsgard  sean bean  katarina witt directed by : john frankenheimer distributed by : metro-goldwyn-mayer mpaa rating : r ( strong violence  some language ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1998/ronin . htm there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences  while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . for fans of both genres  however  realism is key . action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic  and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . on this advice  director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller  ronin . the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing  considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . the script  written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut  approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . a certain number of people will be lost by this  but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . frankenheimer masters the script with poise  and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here  and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam  a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast  especially once the requisite double-crossing begins  and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . at times  however  zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise  the package might become cruise's computer disk . fortunately  the focus here is almost entirely on the package  whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . the action content is impressive  and it lives up to the hints given in previews . the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish  but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . the suspense tapers off considerably by the end  a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well  and it's another good bet this month . since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months  it's definitely worth the visit .

"starring : matt damon  ben affleck  linda fiorentino  chris rock  alan rickman  janeane garofalo  jason lee  jason mewes  kevin smith director : kevin smith written by : kevin smith in the north america of the late 90's  a time and place wherein the description "" devout catholic "" is an oxymoron  you wouldn't think a film like dogma would have had trouble finding a distributor  much less require the painfully self-embarrassed disclaimer which precedes it . surely even the most pious  guilt-ridden rc couldn't possibly take offense to something smith rightly calls a "" comic fantasy  "" something so purposely irreverent it rivals the great schism for sheer  laugh-out-loud ludicrousness . i mean  come on . we're talking about a movie that features damon and affleck as fallen angels ( complete with really fake-looking wings ) who discover a policy loophole that will either allow them to get back into heaven with a clean slate-- or cause the obliteration of everything  depending on whom you ask . we're talking about dusky-voiced fiorentino as a heroine whose family tree contains more 'begot's than the book of genesis  and chris rock as "" rufus  the thirteenth apostle  "" who insists he was written out of the bible because he's black . we're talking about inspired bits of ironic casting like alanis morissette as god  or better yet  george carlin as a cardinal who interprets jesus' "" let the children come unto me  "" as "" get 'em when they're young . "" we're talking about stoners jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and smith  who show up as these same characters in every smith movie ) as prophets  fer chrissakes . by all rights  a film this goofy should have inspired nothing more than simple indifference  and not just in catholics . yet for the most part  it all clicks . damon and affleck are ideal as millennia-old buddies ; their scenes together have a seemingly effortless  comfortable ease  and they even get to poke fun at speculation about their offscreen relationship . certain corporate idolaters are slammed mercilessly  to hilarious effect . even jay's juvenile  expletive-riddled banter  annoying as it can be  often provides a shockingly funny counterpoint when the going threatens to get serious . the film does lose some steam in the late going  however  and the ending doesn't match the promise of the first half . still  dogma ends up being a thoughtful and heartfelt expression of smith's simple message about the difference between ideas and beliefs  faith and religion  and why we're all here .

"starring mark whalberg  burt reynolds  julianne moore and heather graham one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . if a film is only 90 minutes  but feels like 300 minutes  then it's crap . but if a film last 2 1/2 hours  and feels like 90 minutes  then it's excellent . boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . the director  anderson  delivers a funny  hip  yet sometimes violent film  which flies along . mark whalberg  a . k . a marky mark  plays eddie adams  a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area . jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director  who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . after running away from home  eddie joins jack  changes his name to dirk diggler  and starts making erotic movies . in the movie business  dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman )  rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall )  and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written  well played  and the audience gets to know them pretty well  thanks to the excellent script . we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce  rollergirls hard time at school  and little bills wife  who sleeps with everyone except her husband . but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . the direction is fast  thrilling  and never holds up . there are some great shots  some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences  and lots of other neat directional touches . the writing is fabulous  with some intelligent dialogue  some funny dialogue  but none of the dialogue is crap  like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 )  or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . ) boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing  on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) the soundtrack is also excellent . like american graffiti ( 1973 )  the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack  which heightens the atmosphere  and gives the film an extra lift . also  the costumes are great . the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . the film  although excellent  does have some flaws . firstly  wahlberg  although excellent  cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry . in both scenes where he has to act angry  his acting is so 'off'  the scenes tension and anger is lost . but the rest of the cast are excellent . burt reynolds is brilliant  julianne moore shows real emotion  and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) another flaw with the film  though  is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit  and needed to wrap up quickly . it's a shame  really  as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . but they're small niggles really . boogie nights is an excellent film . superb directing  writing  acting and music  all combine to make one spectacular film . whatever you do  do not miss out on boogie nights .

"" ldli  "" his first feature  at the 1997 cannes fesival  received a nomination for a golden camera and a special mention  as did john hurt  from the international critics association . john hurt is present in just about every scene . the thespian has a marvelous track record  mostly in roles as different from one another as they are from deja vu . among them  in "" a man for all seasons  "" "" midnight express  "" "" the elephant man "" ( title role )  "" 1984  "" "" the hit  "" "" white mischief  "" "" scandal  "" "" rob roy . "" he looks like no one else and can act like nobody's business . now in his late 50s  he has the age of giles de'ath in "" love and death on long island . "" british writer de'ath lives in contemporary london but not in this century . a widower ( significantly  his wife was older than he  and they had no children )  he inhabits a world of books in a posh  old-fashioned apartment where his housekeeper follows the man's clockwork routines without intruding into his reclusive habits . he gives no interviews  but when he is finally talked into an appearance on bbc-radio  it is hilarious . giles is befuddled by the questions  the interviewer by the replies . de'ath is truly out of the 20th century in every way . "" do you use a word processor ? "" "" i am a writer "" he snaps  "" i write words  i do not process them . "" not that he has the foggiest about what a processor is . or even a typewriter . a notation in the bbc ledger shows us just two words about the man : "" fogey "" and "" cult . "" this nagged me throughout the movie . if giles has not a clue about life-at-large  we don't have any about the kind of writing he does ; or why he is a figure in the literary establishment ; or what kind of cult surrounds him  and why . nonetheless  giles is a hoot . the radio interviewer had pointed out to giles  who had not been to the pictures in ages  that films have been made of the novels by e . m . forster . later  locked out of his apartment and caught in the rain  giles notices such a film on a movie-house marquee and goes in . but unaware that there are such innovations as multiplexes  he wanders into an american teen flick  "" hotpants college 2 . "" with comic slowness it dawns on him that "" this is not forster . "" he stands up to leave  but sees on the screen a young performer ( jason priestley ) and is entranced by him . giles gets a "" coup de foudre  "" his first ever love-at-first-sight and undoubtedly his first love ever  at any sight . the heart is a mysterious thing . a major fixation is born . the besotted writer sees the picture again  acting at the box-office like the traditonal  funny kid who wants to buy condoms in a drugstore . tracking down the name of the actor ( it is ronnie bostock ) in comically awkward ways  he loads up on teen magazines which he buys and disposes of as though they were pornography . he reads and memorizes all about ronnie  starts a cut-and-paste "" bostockiana "" album . giles further enters pop culture by renting ( more comedy here ) all the bostock videos possible . he purchases a video-player  after first mistaking microwave ovens for such machines  has it delivered by a stupefied young man who explains to giles' surprise that a tv set is required to watch the tapes . passion escalates . after more research  howlers and howl-making episodes  giles takes off for the usa  to the long island village where ronnie and his supermodel girlfriend audrey live by the sea . giles  the innocent at home  becomes the innocent abroad . but by now  the comic tone of the first part acquires a lining of pathos  though without losing various funny delights . the second  american ( though shot in canada ) half  has giles take a room in a motel where mostly couples meet furtively ; be obsessed by his wanting to meet ronnie ; resort to a series of investigations and stalkings that involve everything  from ronnie's dog  his porsche ragtop to giles' becoming a regular at the greasy spoonish establishment owned by irv . it is called "" chez d'irv  "" which somehow sounds like "" chef d'oeuvre "" ( french for "" masterpiece "" ) --a most unlikely bilingual pun  given irv's simple-mindedness love is the mother of inventions . the hitherto very low-key giles goes energetically through loops and hoops  contrives a supermarket "" accident "" to meet audrey  turns on the charm  makes friends with her while waiting for ronnie to return from california . finally  he meets him . de'ath's task is vastly aided by the small community --including the young couple-- being one of naive people with little or no culture . no denizen had ever heard of de'ath  perhaps even of literature . but all are hugely impressed by having an english author in their midst . dull  duller  dullest giles becomes an exotic creature . it reminds me a bit of the newly rich vulgarians who mistake bob hope for an earl in "" fancy pants . "" hurt's performance is probably his best  along with his quentin crisp in "" the naked civil servant . "" in speech  expressivity  body language  timing  he is impeccably in character  ludicrous and absurd yet believable  quasi farcical yet touching . wide-eyed priestley  sporting elvis sideburns that make him look even dimmer  performs with restraint a persona that's partly an un-blatant send-off of his "" beverly hills 90210 "" heartthrob  partly that of a young actor who confusedly feels that there are things to do higher than his teen-junk movie roles . the ground is fertile for giles to lay on with a trowel compliments  bold and bald statements about ronnie's talents and potential  the imaginary film script giles is writing for him . all this  of course  leads to implanting the idea that things can go better  not with coke but with de'ath as a mentor . to what extent giles believes what he says remains an open question . ronnie's is a supporting role to giles' and audrey's ( well played by a relative newcomer ) is one level below this . the balance of the cast are sub-supporters to the top trio  yet all appearances  down to the tiniest  are sharply sketched out . throughout the film  kwietniowski also fleshes out ambiances through light  economical  amusing touches in the peripherals  from tv watching to weather predictions  not to mention telephone answering machines or faxes . november's attraction to may is something common . so is the mismatched attraction of persons widely separated by social class  taste  intellect  culture . examples abound in movies  from somerset maugham's novel "" of human bondage "" ( the good version was filmed with leslie howard and bette davis ) to "" citizen kane "" and beyond . in the case of "" love and death "" all this acquires new twists and an outcome that i cannot disclose . but i can reveal that there is no sex  there are no caricatures . instead  we get heartfelt sentiment and much humor at the expense of the nadirs of pop culture  teen adulation  as well as of stuffy "" high art . "" no closure in its fullest sense comes at the end . certain things are left in the air  with an upbeat last-moment hint about giles . there is audience manipulation here  since the title's "" death "" is a red herring . the name de'ath ( pronounced deh as in irish or italian names ) does really exist  but used without the apostrophe  it suggests to the unprepared public dire events rather than a verbal joke . i'll grant you though that it is a good mnemonic device .

"" pinkett yells at the screen . ) it's funny  creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy  dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . there are other superb set pieces  but explaining them risks ruining their effect . there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original "" scream "" gang  but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . it can be argued that  while the original might outclass it by a tad  scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here  considering how much this person has added to these films ) . sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans  there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like "" the usual suspects  "" "" aliens "" and "" the empire strikes back . "" still  "" scream 2 "" does so many things right  it's petty to quibble . its penchant for parody is irresistible  discussions of the merits of film sequels and all . the attractive  solid cast is a definite bonus . and the denouement ( while not as shocking as "" scream "" 's ) is priceless ; the film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in "" scream "" with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper . all this and a "" scream 3 "" is in the works . knowing the series' tendency for self-reference  perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice . mentioning "" scream 2 "" 'll help them in their argument . © 1997 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/

"wild things reviewed by jamie peckrating :  columbia / 1 : 53 / 1998 / r ( language  violence  nudity  sex ) cast : matt dillon ; neve campbell ; denise richards ; kevin bacon ; daphne rubin-vega ; bill murray ; theresa russell ; robert wagner ; carrie snodgress director : john mcnaughton screenplay : stephen peters jerry springer has got nothing on "" wild things . "" john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality  threesomes  poolside catfights  slutty rich bimbos  even redneck gator-wrestling  they're all part of the movie's raucous  complex storyline . but even trash tv topicality can't drag "" wild things "" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network  only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature )  there's wicked fun to be had here . "" wild things "" would be a guilty pleasure  only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it . high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay  especially by pretty  popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards )  whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent . hoping to take her crush to a physical level  kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser  but  the very next day  tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . before long  blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . lombardo  who maintains his innocence  hires neck brace-sporting  opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . the previews give away the following revelations  so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater  you might want to skip to the next paragraph . while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand  bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her . to pay lombardo for the damages  kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million . but lombardo  kelly and suzie are actually all working together  and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . duquette and perez  however  begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations . if there's a major drawback to "" wild things  "" it's that it's oversexed to a fault . the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon  campbell and richards is a turn-off . it's also cut short ( sorry  guys )  and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . what we don't see is far more effective than what we do . another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . er  no thanks . also  bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . daphne rubin-vega  from broadway's "" rent  "" tries to compensate for a superfluous character . theresa russell is just plain wooden . and when  in the end  all is out in the open  ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable  some not ) that never seems to end . "" wild things "" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews  and most are so gleefully  over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch  especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off . and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen  or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns  plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . speaking of bombshells  denise richards  who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top  does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in "" starship troopers . "" matt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal  and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . neve campbell  lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig  gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . re-edited and toned down a bit  the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . but what we're given works well enough . "" wild things "" is highly entertaining and  indeed  very wild . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ "" suggestions  please  for the fourth movie in the series . how about look who's talking back  ' in which the audience gets its turn ?

"the happy bastard's quick movie reviewfor a minute there  i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest  another adaptation of a legend from the past . ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? yikes ! ) but guess what- disney  a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films  strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who's lost her young adopts him into her group . as he matures into a much older man  tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan  and then arrives a hunter  a professor  and the professor's lovely daughter  jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . from there  tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? the voicework here is pretty top-level . tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne "" newman "" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . the movie is superb throughout  mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one  i might add )  the camera twists and turns  allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . and the music's not half bad  either . fortunately  there's no ridiculous singing characters here  just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . there's some great action sequences here as well  including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan  jane  and the aforementioned babboons . but  of course  it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family . this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library . . . that is  if my vcr still works in the year 2000 .

"finally . we always knew robert rodriguez had talent as a filmmaker . we were just waiting for someone to put a good script in his hands  and kevin williamson has done that here . do not be fooled by the woefully bad trailers  or by the fact that critics have roundly panned this horror film . the faculty is easily the best of the genre to come along since williamson's breakout hit  scream . it is also the first watchable film rodriguez has put up since storming onto the scene with el mariachi . easily the biggest problem with this movie is in the marketing . i can only imagine how pissed off williamson  rodriguez  and everyone else involved in the movie must have been to see the film marketed as just another schlocky entry into the horror genre  which generally takes the words aliens ; teenagers ; battle ; suspicious ; killer ; small town ; etc . and jumble them up to come up with a concept ( to wit  this time : suspicious small town teenagers battle killer aliens ) . now if you are already a big 80's horror fan  just skip this review  because you already saw the movie  but this review is for people who are highly suspicious of shelling out eight bucks to see a horror flick . the only reason i actually saw the faculty was because my little sister begged me to . but now i'm trying to convince you to . actually  the faculty is just as witty as scream  slightly less original  but makes up with it by acknowledging its status as essentially an update of donald siegel's 1956 classic invasion of the body snatchers  one of the most frightening movies ever made  before hollywood began trying to make you jump in your seat rather than truly fear the end of the world . granted  with robert rodriguez and his frenetic camera involved  this update heightens the sense of urgency and makes you hop up a time or two . but  unlike his substance-lite stylizations in desperado and from dusk till dawn  rodriguez manages to hold onto the wit and character of williamson's script and fashion a film that not only gets your heart racing  but also manages enough intelligence to force you to suspend your disbelief . to top it all off  the faculty throws in some good breakfast club social commentary about high school social hierarchy  and examines the lasting effects of a surreal experience on such an ingrained social order . granted  the faculty's not schindler's list  but if you give it a chance it will make you think a little bit . which is a good thing .

"what starts out as a monotonous talking-head musical history lecture turns into a rich land of louisiana discovery  as robert mugge adventures into the various landscapes of that colorful state . three different sections of louisiana are documented along the journey  northern  southern  and southwestern louisiana  separated by maps and cutesy subtitles . the latter two are the best installments  in that they allow the charismatic performers direct camera time without the interference of a boring onscreen interviewer . each county has a different character  style  instruments  and sound  all distinct in their origins  as local experts tell us  and mugge respectfully picks up these discerning traits . where one town declares that race isn't an issue  the other shows how racial tensions actually aided in black and white musicians inspiring one another . southern louisiana has a strong cajun/creole base  while northern louisiana leans towards guitar and a cappella singing . as a whole  this documentary is well layered with performance and testimony but could easily have been shorter and made the same impact on an audience . in the first section especially  numerous concert performances run superfluously through an entire song  with the camera panning to and fro  looking for something to do . every person put in front of the camera is introduced  but only half the multitude leave much of a mark . the director of the louisiana folk festival expounds on the glories of louisiana's past for an interminable period of time  but most of what he says goes in what ear and out the other . on the other hand  there's a remarkably short section devoted to a 28-year disc jockey veteran  sister pearlee tolliver . she spends her two hours on the radio exclaiming commercials in a gospel voice  with a couple of records thrown in  and she amuses too much to forget . as standard documentaries go  the expected talking heads are mixed in with live concert performances . but most endearing are the discussions with actual performers about their influences and playing style  and reminiscences about their colleagues . these interviews  juxtaposed with the local connoisseurs  provide a solid foundation for the musically ignorant and die hard fan . one of the best portraits is that of kermit ruffins  a local favorite in southwestern louisiana . he takes the historical roots of jazz and blues and mixes them with his own modern experiences growing up in the streets . popularity hasn't blown his ego either  as once in a while he barbeques for his audience out of the back of his truck . other details compliment this musical voyage . the first record store in louisiana  floyd's  is renowned for shipping impossible-to-find music all over the world . the original owner still runs it and helps to promote new talent such as rosie ledet . rosie was a housewife who taught herself how to play the accordion and she now sings and tours with her husband's band . at once mousy and humble  this lady has gone on to break ground for female artists in the zydeco field . before walking into to this film  one might think that all of louisiana could be clumped into a simple stereotype . it takes a while to be interested in the material  but once the filmmaker moves onto southern louisiana  it's hard to look away from the screen .

""   "" well  "" he shouts  laughing  "" isn't that obvious ? "" the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman .   bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated .   suddenly  in the short span of this weekend  bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation  and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent .   his script and direction are both extremely sharp  as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself .   here is a man who's reached his limit  and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure .   i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations  but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) .   some of the segments are simply hilarious  such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him .   much of the film is completely absurd  but that's the fun part about it .   it's an angry  serious film at the core  but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre .   what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale .   beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny  but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .   beatty is so good that bulworth  despite his shortcomings as a human being  is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . the supporting cast is vast and colorful .   berry is luminous  as always  and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles .   don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work .   oliver platt is an actor who should be careful  for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) .   paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . is bulworth offensive ?   i suppose some may see it that way .   i wasn't offended by the film  but then again  i hardly care about politics .   i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story .   the film isn't perfect  of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me  and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) .   but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film .   bulworth is a smart  uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface .

"john carpenter's vampires ( 1998 ) a film review by justin felix . copyright 1998 justin felix . all of my film reviews are archived at http : //us . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? justin + felix this review also appears in the shrubbery -- http : //www . theshrubbery . prohosting . com/1298/movie3 . html screenplay by don jakoby . based on the novel vampire$ by john steakley . directed by john carpenter . starring james woods  daniel baldwin  sheryl lee  thomas ian griffith  maximilian schell . rated r ( contains violence  nudity  and profanity ) 107 mins . synopsis : swearing  cigar-smoking professional vampire slayer jack crow leads his buddy tony  a prostitute  and a catholic priest into battle against valek  the world's first vampire  who is searching for the means to be able to live in sunlight . comments : as i write this  halloween 1998 is a three-week old memory  and thanksgiving is quickly approaching . hollywood released a slew of horror and horror-related movies right before and closely after halloween  and these movies are now slowly making their way through second-run  cheap theaters . the season brought us the campy bride of chucky  the screamish urban legend  and the more serious apt pupil  based on a short story by stephen king . a latecomer  the sequel i still know what you did last summer  came out on november  friday the 13th ( aren't they just so clever marketing a slasher movie on friday the 13th ? ) . having seen all these films except the last ( which has been slammed by most critics )  i can safely say that john carpenter's vampires  released the day before halloween  was the best horror film created for the holiday . this does not necessarily mean it was a great film--the aforementioned flicks were mediocre at best--but it is entertaining  especially for horror  action  and "" b-movie "" fans . john carpenter has done a number of film classics in his long and varied career ( however  he's also produced some turkeys ) . his chief accomplishment  so far at least  is the little 1978 film halloween  a film which became a huge hit and launched the teen slasher genre  including the friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street cycles . he's also done a number of solid horror and sci-fi movies : the fog  they live  starman  and a remake of the 50s classic the thing . carpenter  unfortunately  seemed to be losing his touch recently . he directed kurt russell through the bad escape from la and christopher reeves through the even worse village of the damned ( a lousy remake ) . carpenter somewhat needed a film to resolidify his standing as a premiere talent . john carpenter's vampires  at least  is a step in the right direction . vampires  throughout film history  seem to be very popular with movie audiences . from bela lugosi's classic turn as dracula in the successful universal classic to christopher lee in england's hammer cycle to recent big budget epics like bram stoker's dracula and interview with the vampire  these creatures of the night continue to rake in profits . subtle changes in the vampire myths as they get translated through the decades may allow for enough variety to keep people interested . this year  for example  wesley snipes played blade  a vampire slayer from marvel comics  combining the vampire with the comic book hero . john carpenter's vampires  similarly  combines vampires with another genre  the western ( interestingly  the western had just been combined with another genre  science fiction  in soldier ) . the results end up as an interesting mixed bag . john carpenter's vampires begins promisingly . within a beautiful new mexico landscape  jack crow leads his motley crew of vampire killers into an infested  dilapidated house far removed from civilization . apparently  crow's crew kills bloodsuckers in a unique manner : they pierce them with cables attached to a running truck outside . the vampires are thus yanked from the darkness of their abode and into the sunlight  where they quickly flare up into ashes . the scene is effectively scary yet sets up the film's darkly humorous tone as well . after this beginning  however  the movie slows to a crawl for about half an hour as the major conflict between jack crow and the original vamp valek is set up . whether you like john carpenter's vampires or not will largely depend upon whether or not you like the actors . james woods does a wickedly fun turn as the lead vampire slayer . he brings a manic energy which fits the character perfectly . thomas ian griffith deserves an equal nod as the very effective valek . he informs the vampire with a menacing quality equal to that of other classic actors like bela lugosi . if you do not like these actors  especially woods  however  you probably won't like this movie  as it serves almost like a vehicle for the two . as a side note  the highly respected maximilian schell does a supporting role here -- this makes * two * so-so hollywood movies he's appeared in this year ( the other being the somewhat cheesy deep impact ) . john carpenter's vampires is remarkedly different from the other horror movies released this past month and a half in that not even a single teenager graces the screen . bride of chucky  urban legend  i still know what you did last summer . . . all of them center upon teenagers . john carpenter's vampires features an entirely adult cast . this doesn't necessarily mean the behavior of these characters  however  is any more informed by intelligence . people do stupid things in this movie just like any other horror movie . one of the reasons  though  that i only give this film three stars is the attitude the main characters have . jack crow and tony montoya are uncomfortably misogynistic . they kidnap a prostitute who has been bitten by valek and treat her like absolute crud . although she is turning into a vampire  their treatment of her still seems cruel and passionless . the storyline's only major fault is to suggest that montoya falls in love with her . crow's treatment of members of the catholic priesthood will probably offend some too . in one scene  for instance  crow kicks the crap out of a priest to get information  then asks the priest whether he was turned on by the abuse or not . despite these faults  the final hour of john carpenter's vampires picks up speed and is highly entertaining . not much more may be said without giving away some of the plot's resolution ; however  the final showdown between crow's "" gang "" and valek's "" posse "" in a deserted town combines the genres of the western and horror quite well . ultimately  sitting through the first half-hour is rewarded by the finale . john carpenter's vampires is deservedly rated r . it contains many scenes of graphic violence  some nudity  and several words and phrases which will never make it to commercial network tv . this one's worth catching before it comes out on video . you could probably still

"starring-sean connery  catherine zeta-jones  ving rhames and will pattonmovie views by jamey hughton : http : //welcome . to/movieviewsanyone who says sean connery is getting too old for action movies hasn't seen his latest movie . connery will always be remembered as the definitive james bond  and in entrapment  part of the fun is watching him replay certain shades that made his portrayal of the famous spy so popular . his age is starting to show  but you have to hand it to mr . connery  because he sure is a good sport . in entrapment he plays mac  a master thief with high-tech gadgets for scaling buildings and stealing antique rembrandts for his personal collection . he catches the eye of an insurance agent ( ! ! ) named gin baker  catherine zeta-jones . with the news that a priceless chinese mask is being displayed in a london museum  zeta-jones knows that mac won't be able to resist the chance to snatch it . so she tracks him down and poses as a thief  proposing that the two become partners in crime and attempt the daring heist . of course  her boss ( will patton ) wants her to bring mac in afterward . but carefully predicting the pattern of their meetings  you can surely guess that their relationship will escalate to something more than business . zeta-jones is 29  and connery is now 68 . with this enormous age differential  can the stars still create believable chemistry ? the answer is a surprising yes . director jon amiel plays their relationship on a different level than just a love story  in fact  he stages their confrontations like they were father and daughter . if this is simply a massive error  then it was a turn for the better  because this way the stars are given more breathing room and their chemistry is still believable . in one scene toward the end  when the two burglars separate  you realize that you actually care about their situation . even if he could play her grandpa . one disappointement is the use of the supporting cast . ving rhames is once again electric and involving  as one of mac's former partners  but he is criminally underused with his undemanding role . maury chaykin hams it up as a budha-like art dealer . will patton has little to do playing zeta-jones' boss . amiel also uses a fade-out approach to end many of his scenes  which gets very repetitive very quickly . but  entrapment is still an exciting heist adventure that glides along smoothly after a bumpy first hour . the final robbery that the duo pull  an 8-billion bank caper on the eve of the millenium  is simply terrific . i never even glanced at my watch through the two-hour running time . catherine zeta-jones gives a flawed but luminous performance  and connery is just a lot of fun to watch . reports indicate he may return once more as james bond . no matter how old he is then  i'll probably still buy it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . movie views by jamey hughton : http : //welcome . to/movieviews

"by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking  moving  and completely unsentimental . i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant  which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . city of angels is a wonderful film  enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story  and avoids most of the cliches we're so used to seeing in films like this . city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders' 1988 film wings of desire . i have yet to see wings of desire  so i am  unfortunately  unable to make a comparison of the two . i have heard  however  that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways  which makes me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of its source material . nicolas cage stars as seth  an angel who  like all of his angel counterparts  is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . one day  he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan )  and his attention is called to her . the angels can make themselves seen to humans  but they can't experience any of the senses ( most importantly  touch ) . he shows himself to maggie  and she falls for him  unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . seth wants to become human so he can feel her . that's when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz )  "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . "" ( as a side note  i found messinger to be the most fascinating character  for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know  it sounds ridiculous  but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation  she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . this  of course  is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall  he is human  and happy to feel what it's like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . since i love this film so much  i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect . although it is original and mesmerizing  it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent  and steel has done a great job with them ) . the ending  too  could have been more powerful and less predictable . these elements are minor  though  and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . the acting is superb from everyone involved . this is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . he's quiet and pensive  and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . he's perfect for a role like this  and at the same time he reassures us he's not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it  as he shows in face/off ) . meg ryan is a powerful  enticing  and appealingly-chirpy actress  and her work here is some of her best . dennis franz  however  steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . director brad silberling is a talented man  and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters  rather than forced sentimentality . his direction is steady  and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning  maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . this is the way stories should be told  and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i've seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . the music  by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient )  is perfect for this film : it's quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! )  and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . it's a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously .

"a standoff . a man holds a woman  a diplomat's daughter  hostage in his embrace  a gun pressed to her head . a cop  impaired by drink due to his wife's philandering  trains his gun on the man's nether regions  threatening to shoot . another cop holds his gun to his partner's temple  forcing him to disarm . the scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridge--upping the ante  signaling tacitly  going for game . the second cop retrieves the first cop's weapon  the suspect lowers his  and the woman caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety . it is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move  grabbing for the assailant's gun . the room turns upside down  a shot rings out  a cop is down . shot in the back and paralyzed for life . the young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn't commit . storytelling has always been one of pedro almodóvar's greatest gifts and in "" live flesh "" he gives us a twisting  turning  compelling tale peppered with well-written  colorful characters . characters who find themselves  more often than not  in carefully-constructed scenes like these . characters played by actors we might not know  but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless . take the ruggedly handsome victor plaza ( liberto rabal )  for instance . before he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almodóvar favorite  antonio banderas . when we first meet elena ( francesca neri )  the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown  she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair  but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis . elena's husband david ( javier bardem ) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmer's bemused expression throughout . playing the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are josé sancho and angela molina--no lookalikes spring to mind  but they round out the excellent cast . it's a credit to almodóvar's craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity . "" live flesh "" begins and ends with a live birth and the film's contradictions come almost as often as the contractions . between the two childbearings  coincidence  irony  and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film . although based on a ruth rendell story  "" live flesh "" is brimming with the acclaimed spanish director's high-heeled flourishes . women are at times alluring and repulsive  their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama  an eye bruised by an abusive husband here  a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there . while in prison  victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible  quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as "" guardians of a sick flock . "" victor's pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo . "" dear son  i got cancer "" his mother writes to him in jail . she dies before he is released and it's at the cemetery that victor is reacquainted with elena--redemption  ultimately  substituting for revenge .

"cast : tom cruise  thandie newton  ving rhames  dougray scott  william r . mapother  anthony hopkins  rade serbedzija written by : robert towne directed by : john woo running time : 123 minutes screening theater : starnet pablo 9 theaters - jacksonville beach  fl "" well this is not mission : difficult  mr . hunt  it's mission : impossible . difficult should be a walk in the park for you . "" ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins )  the series' new agent phelps  takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch . a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection . a rogue imf agent  sean ambrose ( dougray scott )  wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) . posing as ethan hunt  ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure  not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do . the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods . ethan and nyah fall quickly in love  but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose's . reluctantly  he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team . ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah . although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success  audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new  i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) . that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry  robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo . the end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while . unfortunately  the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow  dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series . ethan's conflict is a compelling one  but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) . john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place  featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups . the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film . thankfully though  at the point ambrose discovers nyah's deception  mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed . robert towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus . after that  the action scenes just begin to build in intensity  as is the case with many of woo's previous high-octane films . the final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer  unfortunately ) . as far as summer entertainment goes  mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare . anyone looking for hardcore action won't be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film  perhaps ) . even if you weren't a fan of the first film  this entry deserves some checking out .

"" endings and the third ending being the actual ending . now for the dvd release you get two choices . you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you . ( note : there's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this . after watching the film with a randomly selected ending  when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it . when you do  a secret menu opens  allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) now while i applaud the effort of paramount here  as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc  it just doesn't work well . first  why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only . i'm no technical dvd expert  but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish . secondly  the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious  thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction . finally  the back of the dvd case states "" and now  with this special dvd version  you can see all 3 surprise endings "" . i have no idea why they would word it that way  since that's not a special feature in the slightest . the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord  has it been that long ? ) and it's played on television with all three endings all the time . these are merely minor complaints however  seeing that i've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd . the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy  and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

"probably the most popular and praised film of all time  turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism . everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time . and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron  combining visual -and sound effects  he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere . i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes . while their cabin is slowly filling up with water  a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- "" . . and they lived happily ever after . . "" . and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air . however  the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie  while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues . in the present day  the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton )  a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond  lost during the sinking . somewhere inside the ship  lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead . here  in the shape of a nude young lady  is a window into the distant age of 1912 . lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson  claiming that she is a model . she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel  and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years . as the memories come flooding back  she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet )  the fiancée of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) . on board there are rich and poor  everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master  captain e . j . smith ( bernard hill ) . on board the ship  rose  unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist  poor  brave and attractive . a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes  but also face the greatest power on earth - death . cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight ""  as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple  and not on the disaster itself . the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera . the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script . because of its primitive and predictable plot  titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking . russel carpenter's rich  majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy . everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch . but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them . the actors are not to blame  because their characters are more like caricatures  in other words - fake . jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist  handsome  brave  honest  strong  funny . . . you name it . he doesn't have any dark side  he doesn't make any mistakes  that for a second would make him human . jack is perfect  but he is - poor . on the other hand we have cal . he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be . he lacks everything jack possesses  but he is -- rich . this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture . cameron knows precisely what we want to see . his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors  a "" tragic love story ""  beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects )  a dose of social criticism  a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last  but not least - an incredible media support  which proclaimed an average picture the "" greatest film of all time "" . on the outside titanic looks perfect  but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about . the main weakness of this film  which ironically became its success  is simplicity . cameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love  hate  fear and helplessness . everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship . titanic is a typical hollywood production  totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot . it's a good picture  but absolutely not a masterpiece . it's among hundreds and thousands good films released every year  not better or worse than the average american film .

"release date : february 19  1999 starring : jake gyllenhaal  laura dern  chris owen  william lee scott  chad lindberg  chris cooper  natalie canerday directed by : joe johnston distributed by : universal pictures mpaa rating : pg ( language  brief teen sensuality and alcohol use  some thematic elements ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/october . htm since 1990  the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . now  instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues  the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times  as 1993's schindler's list shows . most of today's mainstream drama  however  creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . that's why pictures like october sky  which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear  are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal )  a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood  west virginia . it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . the mine  which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper )  is not the place for homer  however . after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957  homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it  "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . "" drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast  homer begins to construct rockets . with the help of their history teacher  miss riley ( laura dern )  and several mine workers  the four are soon bound for great things . october sky is a skillfully crafted film  and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here . he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . he does not push any barriers  but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm . his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers  or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father . the cast is well chosen  although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher  giving the boys the support and guidance they need . her role is instantly likeable . chris cooper ( the horse whisperer )  as homer's father  is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . he's definitely a driving force in homer's life  and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . the script is generally cheerful  projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . it highlights the essence of youth  however  and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . october sky should be a success with audiences . although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that  it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre  and one that everyone should see .

"bob the happy bastard's quickie review : brendan fraser's stuck in the past again  but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . fraser is the lead star of the mummy  the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film  and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages  like boris karloff was engulfed in . but who cares  the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from  oh  say  godzilla or armageddon . fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . basically  it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . his plan- wake back up and wake her up also  making him invincible . of course  fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna )  along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j . o'connor ) and some "" americans "" . . . and guess what ? yup  ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . fire flies from the sky  flesh-eating beetles crawl about  and  well  ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold . ok  so it's not really all that new a story  but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch  and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either . the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . no  it's no phantom menace beater  but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season  you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy . if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man  then nothing will .

"scream 2  directed by wes craven . written by kevin williamson . starring neve campbell  courtney cox  david arquette . only a year after the initial release of "" scream  "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre  the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters . while the tongue-in-cheek  parodic element is still noticeable in this film  it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . the first film  while often violent and gruesome  was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab  "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream  "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . its conclusion  in which a bleeding  wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt  is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and  interestingly enough  how they are usually inferior to their predecessors )  the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning  and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time . more importantly  this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact  the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense )  weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety  and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . understandably  "" scream 2 "" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies  but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . couple that with the fact that several of the characters  most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell )  are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense  and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and  in one case  a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . while i have not seen any of his other work  it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director  as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . unfortunately  "" scream 2 "" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . for example  several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick  but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . . . well  it's hard to say . i gave the first "" scream "" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . "" scream 2 "" bounces all over the place stylistically  but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . i'm not sure which is the better movie  but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels  however much randy might argue  do not necessarily suck .

"a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite . they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too . they're usually not too deep  allowing for semi-brainless relaxation  and at the same time  not too dumb . men in black is a four-star three-star film . ( hope you could follow that one ) men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun . just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones )  introduced to an alien  and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use . after all  you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ? men in black is  of course  the organization which "" moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth "" . nypd officer james edwards ( will smith )  is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes . the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end  and with that  dives off of a roof . naturally nobody believes his story . . . nobody that is  except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of . edwards then meets agent kay  the man who never seems to crack a smile  and is introduced to the mib . edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate  drivers license  and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) . james edwards no longer exists . meet agent jay . agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about "" regular "" duties . eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play . a "" bug "" has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it . the plot isn't exactly clear  but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth  and that is crucial that the mib find it before the "" bug "" does . barry sonnenfeld  who also did the addams family films  directs this nicely . it's fun  it's funny  it's action-packed . a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be . this is one of those movies that is just "" fun "" and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer . will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch . definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97  men in black comes highly recommeded from me !

"the always over-the-top underrated don knotts kicked off his first of a string of family films with this delightful comedy with a dash of horror . luther heggs ( knotts ) is a bug-eyed type-setter for the local newspaper  he's always dreamed of becoming a first-class reporter but newspaper manager ollie ( skip homeier ) makes fun of him and won't let him write any stories . luther is driving along when a man is hit over the head in front of the town's spooky old simmons mansion that everyone says is haunted . convinced that they can scare him away from the paper for good  ollie and george beckett ( dick sargent ) decide to let him write a story  what's the catch you ask ? he has to write it about his overnite stay in the simmons house . much to his horror he finds that things go bump in the night  the organ plays by itself  and a pair of garden shears are stabbed in the neck of a bleeding portrait . he writes of his experiences and the town declares him a hero . finding it unsuitable against the family name  nicholas simmons ( philip ober ) challenges luther to prove what he saw . of course  the same things never happen again  and he can't prove the secret passageway that he found . nicholas is trying to bulldoze the house because he wants to cover up the family's secret past . the film is classic knotts  the movie sets him up well and he's wonderful as usual . sadly the film is flawed  most of the character's motivations and thoughts are pretty obvious from the beginning . most non-knotts dialouge is boring and weak . plus  the trailer ( which appears before the movie ) shows almost every second of luther's confrontation in the spooked house . but i am a fan of knotts  where the geeky wide-eyed man gets the girl . the film is funny  but predictable  and not original  so it gets * * * stars .

"jackie chan may not make the best films  but there's no question that he makes some of the most entertaining and audience-friendly ones . "" it's not bach  "" a friend once said  "" but it is at least offenbach . "" "" who am i ? ""  a hong kong production which was released direct-to-video through columbia tristar  is very much in the same vein as "" rumble in the bronx "" . its plot is mostly a clothesline on which jackie hangs as many stunts  visual gags  bits of derring-do  slapstick  and everything else that isn't hammered down . and what of the plot  you ask ? jackie plays a member of a secret military platoon who're deployed to get their hands on a meteorite fragment that can be used as an energy source . the platoon is betrayed from within  and jackie takes a chuteless nosedive from his helicopter . he wakes up  sans memory  in the care of a jungle tribe . "" who am i ? "" he cries out  and the running ( homeric ? ) gag of the movie is that whoami becomes his name . ( the tribe  btw  is depicted with a surprising amount of sensitivity and intelligence given the movie's pedigree . they've got t-shirts and binoculars  and understand that jackie fell out of a crashed copter  not some great metal sky-bird . ) the movie actually gets a lot less mileage out of jackie's memory loss as a plot device  but it gets a lot of mileage regardless . jackie saves a motorcross driver from snakebite ( driving the atv over the finish line himself ) ; gets mixed up with a journalist who wants to write about his story ; wrecks a mitsubishi sports car ; winds up in the netherlands  throwing wooden shoes at the bad guys ; and gets into a rooftop fight with two astonishingly brutal savate' fighters . the usual stuff  but it's served up with a good sense of fun and a fast-moving camera . and of course  we get to see jackie's end-of-movie outtakes . it wouldn't be a jackie chan film without at least one shot of him on the stretcher -- although this time around  we get to * hear * outtakes as well  from the studio sessions where jackie sang the title tune . and as a singer  jackie's mostly a pretty good stuntman . like the man says : not bach  i guess  but certainly offenbach . -----------== posted via deja news  the discussion network ==---------- http : //www . dejanews . com/ search  read  discuss  or start your own

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy  light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight  but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong  bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects  featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts )  a successful new york restaurant critic  and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago  she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney )  a sports writer  that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28  they had promised to marry each other . both julianne and michael are both single  of course  and when george inquires about michael's age  julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday  and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . however  she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz )  and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding  julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael  and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . the setup for my best friend's wedding  then  is a fairly conventional one  and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan  whose first feature  muriel's wedding  had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story  and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding  which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . for example  there's a heartfelt  emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers  inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks  harmonizing in the background . my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film  and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . in a typical romantic-comedy  kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty  conniving ice queen  and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here  kimmy is sweet  sincere  and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life  she'd actually like her too . the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding  he gets to have a playful  mischievous and charming personality . throughout the film  the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists  and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting  vivid  and likeable characters  with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts  who turns in a top-notch  confident and reassured performance as julianne . this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic  fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here  remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience  if not entirely sympathetic  even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz  who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . with a smile which lights up the screen  she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner  and never hits a false note in the film . she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of "" i just don't know what to do with myself "" . rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george  and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . his george is a bit of a devilish rogue  entirely affable  and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun  and his joy is infectuous . dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film  he's not given a lot to do  but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney  and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . when julia roberts' lustre began to fade  and she was usurped from her title as "" america's sweetheart "" by sandra bullock  i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . while that didn't quite work out  it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990  the romantic-comedy  will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts  and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy .

"if there's one thing sandra bullock desperately needs  it's a decent script to get her career restarted . after a series of flops ( "" speed 2 ""  "" forces of nature "" )  she needs a good script with a good costar . well  "" gun shy "" is a rather entertaining script  and she has the always great liam neeson as her costar  but there are two serious problems : first  the film was released at what could be the worst possible time  the same weekend as "" scream 3 . second  sandra bullock appears in perhaps six scenes throughout the film . everyone finished gasping in disbelief ? that's right folks  despite what the previews may have led you to believe  "" gun shy "" is hardly a romantic comedy because there is seldom a female presence . the thing is  the film might be better as a result . charlie mayough ( liam neeson ) is an undercover dea officer who is on his last assignment before retirement . the problem is  he can't bring himself complete the assignment unless he constantly attends group therapy to keep his nerves under control . charlie's final assignment involves catching illegal funds on a group of mafia types  led by the uptight fulvio ( oliver platt ) . as a result of charlie's nerves  he's having another problem  which involves his  uh  bowles . well  he visits a proctologist named jane ( sandra bullock )  who promises she can fix all his anxiety problems in two weeks by dating him . it's not very often that a romantic subplot feels quite so tacked on as it does here . bullock's character serves absolutely no purpose  other than to give charlie occasional words of encouragment and to solve his prostatic difficulties . in fact  if her character had been eliminated entirely and more of the film had focused on oliver platt and his cohorts  this probably would have been a much better film . speaking of oliver platt  he is a riot as a hit man who hates being made up entirely of cliches . the truth is  oliver platt makes this movie . liam neeson may be a great actor  but he isn't given much to work with here . platt  on the other hand  is given some truly great scenes . for example  near the start of the film  platt is seated across from a neighbor  telling him that in the middle east they chop the hands off thieves . he then prepares to do this to the neighbor for reasons we're not quite sure of  but it's hysterical when we find out . charlie's sessions with his therapy group are fairly amusing  particularly when he runs into one of them while on assignment . unfortunately  any other time when oliver platt is not on screen  things tend to drag some . we're also introduced to someone that may possibly be the most irritating character i've seen in years . jason ( i believe played by andrew lauer ) is a big time wallstreet dealer  who shows up to invest the gangsters' money . he is about five foot ten  has an obnoxious  high pitched voice  and laughs insanely at everything . after seeing him on screen for about ten minutes  i really wanted to kill this character with my bare hands . i was tempted to knock a half star off my rating simply because he was present . the other supporting characters  while certainly eccentric  are more amusing than annoying . watch for an appearance by mitch pileggi  of x-files fame  as charlie's boss . the funny thing is  it's almost the exact same character he plays in "" the x-files "" . one last thing i must note is that i had a very hard time imagining a beautiful proctologist going out with one of her patients right after attending to him . i had an even harder time believing that charlie could have made it through the first date without constantly thinking about everything she had seen . "" gun shy "" is obviously not an incredible comedy . it is  however  an amusing  harmless little comedy that has has a lot of chuckles and a few true belly laughs . the film may only run 100 minutes  but things do tend to drag a bit by the end  which is drawn out well past what is needed . i'd recommend the film to fans of liam neeson and oliver platt  but not to fans of sandra bullock  since there isn't much of her in it . i give it three and a half out of five stars .

"" magnolia "" is a clever  well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of "" boogie nights "" fame . the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make "" magnolia "" memorable . however  what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories  the film is never confusing . anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "" magnolia's "" scenes drag on too long . any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring . it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . for example  cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes  races  and genders suffer . anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . the performances in "" magnolia "" are perfection . this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . anderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best  character acting . all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . worth noting is tom cruise  who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife . she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . "" magnolia "" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .

"for more reviews and movie news  visit http : //www . joblo . com/plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon  to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings  gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this . a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams  works hard  devotes the time  the energy and the patience  and ultimately hits it big-time . in the case of this film  our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup  luck always finds its way into these types of equations  although generally tied very closely to hard work )  they need a new singer . his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore  i still check out my motley crue  twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music  but the music and live performances from the band  play a big part in the movie  and i for one  had a blast watching and listening to it all . but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . wow  hand this fella some major props  as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally  metal god was the film's original title  and a much better one if you ask me ) . he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic  who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet )  but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne  jeff pilson from dokken  stephan jenkins from third eye blind  blas elias from slaughter )  but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay  as in this film ) . just for the record  i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements  since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies  but because it's a fun  uplifting  well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . oh yeah  and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music  the soundtrack also rocks ! ! you see . . . dreams can come true . . . where's joblo coming from ? almost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 )

"1997  r  95 minutes [1 hour  35 minutes]starring : dustin hoffman ( stanley motss )  robert de niro ( conrad brean )  anne heche ( winifred ames )  denis leary ( fad king )  written by hilary henkin  david mamet ; produced by robert de niro  barry levinson  jane rosenthal ; directed by barry levinson ; based on the novel "" american hero "" by larry beinhart . satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything  including the jokes  is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . "" dr . strangelove "" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . "" men in black "" ) . what's unique about "" wag the dog "" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions  and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedy based on an original  smart premise  even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness . in this age of information and technology  we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things  it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news  but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas  and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics  the media coverage of politics  and the entertainment industry are so closely related  couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro )  a professional washington spin doctor  comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . brean  along with the president's top advisor  winifred ames ( heche )  fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . they pitch him an idea to "" produce "" the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it ) . soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play . we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation  such as a folk singer  visual and sound effects technicians  and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv  in the movies  or in the news . the characters' dialogue is witty and funny  although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . for example  one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry  but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . since it's all computer-enhanced anyway  she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . but then there's the gags and one-liners that  although are humorous  seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name  or  whenever a problem emerges  always responding with  "" this is nothing ! "" by the time the film makes it to the midpoint  everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . the first act is quickly paced  while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with  and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . however  it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . what had started off as a brilliant  somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . still  the situation comedy is quite funny  especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time  but think about afterwards and "" wag the dog "" at least succeeds in this respect . however  in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done  namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . then again  it's a valiant effort . please visit chad'z movie page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 180 new and old films reviewed in depth  not just blind ratings and quick capsules . also  check out the first shay astar web page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz/shayastar . html

"er is een leuke vondst in deze film . in het amerika van "" the gingerbread man "" woedt er een grote orkaan  genaamd geraldo . met deze naam verwijst ohn grisham naar de onderwerpen in deze film : scheidingen  ontvoeringen  mysterieuze sektes  stoere advocaten en drugsverslaving . met "" the gingerbread man "" heeft grisham dus een andere weg ingeslagen . samen met regisseur robert altman heeft hij ervoor gezorgd dat deze film een stuk realistischer is dan de anderen . rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) is een succesvolle advocaat  die gescheiden is van leeanne ( famke janssen ) en niet vaak z'n kinderen ziet . na een grote zaak gewonnen te hebben  gaat hij terug naar z'n kantoor om de overwinning met z'n collega's te vieren . aan het einde van de avond heeft magruder genoeg op en besluit terug naar huis te rijden . dan ziet hij dat iemand een auto steelt en er meteen mee vandoor gaat . de eigenaresse van de wagen  serveerster mallory doss ( embeth davidtz )  blijft alleen achter . magruder biedt z'n hulp aan en samen rijden ze naar haar huis . eenmaal aangekomen ontdekken ze dat haar auto nu voor het huis geparkeerd is . doss gaat samen met magruder voorzichtig naar binnen  in de veronderstelling dat de dief nu binnen is . de deur is open  de televisie staat aan en de lichten zijn nu opeens volop aan het schijnen . het komt doss zeer bekend voor en al snel heeft ze in de gaten wat er aan de hand is : haar vader dixon doss ( robert duvall )  lid van een mysterieuze groep  is weer begonnen met 'stalken' . magruder wilt haar graag helpen en geeft deze zaak aan clyde ( robert downey jr . )  die graag aan de drank zit . de vader wordt snel gevonden en naar de rechtbank gebracht . daar wordt hij schuldig bevonden . luid protesterend gaat hij naar de gevangenis . magruder en doss denken nu dat de zaak gesloten is . fout . de rest van de sekte weet dixon uit de gevangenis te halen  zodat hij weer kan beginnen met het stalken van z'n dochter . met nu iin verschil : de kinderen van magruder worden nu ook bedreigd . magruder krijgt het benauwd en haalt in een paniekerige bui z'n kinderen van schhool . maar dat blijkt niet genoeg te zijn . . . dat robert altman de regisseur is van deze film  is te merken . "" the gingerbread man "" druipt namelijk van de sfeer . met veel regen  stormen en orkanen wordt de toon gezet voor duistere  persoonlijke zaken . het geeft de film iets bijzonders  net zoals de mooie openingsschne . ook zorgt de orkaan 'geraldo' voor veel spannende momenten  want het is in feite een voorbode van wat er gebeuren zal . ondanks de eerder genoemde pluspunten blijft "" the gingerbread man "" een doorsnee thriller . de rol van tom berenger als pete randle  ex-man van mallory doss  is zo klein  dat het net zo goed weggeschreven kon worden . ook zijn er veel gaten in het verhaal  zodat de kijker vaak in het duister moet tasten . niettemin is deze thriller van robert altman een intrigerende  sfeervolle film . de ouwe kerel heeft z'n stijl niet verloren .

"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities  because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits  like jurassic park  and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list . however  in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . one of them is close encounters of the third kind  extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . unfortunately  it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects  brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon  and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . when spielberg began work on that project  he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit  jaws . together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation  like kauffman  carpenter  hill and millius  he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s  when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . ironically  it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy . but in the mid 1970s  many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . although very personal  spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology  but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost  unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss )  power company worker from muncie  indiana  who later becomes obsessed with his experience . because of his obsession he loses his job  family and sanity  but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon )  single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . in the meantime  the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government  in co-operation with the french  led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary  he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . the slow  gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . but  instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws  we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big  magnificent and wonderful is about to happen  and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . the last sequence  with its  even in this age  impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull  would leave many mouths open . one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . aliens  who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema  are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . it is very ironic  when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . but  even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . there lies the main  and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict  and consequently  lack of drama . the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally  almost everyone - neary  jillian  government  aliens - are the good guys . despite such shortcomings  the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary  yet nice guy  who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . melinda dillon was  on the other hand  nominated for "" oscar "" as a struggling mother  yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie . apart from visual wonders of this film  spielberg's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music  this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot  and as the basis for his score . the aliens  who are the main subject of this film  were visually very convincing . too convincing  one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . according to him  the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate  that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . so  they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien  this time designed to be anything but the real life . the result was e . t .  for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times  yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . anyway  whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos  close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie  and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema .

"member of the 'internet movie critic's association' http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html the easiest noun to use in describing 'mercury rising' would be "" routine "" . it's a simple description but it fits . i have to say up front that the movie is mildly entertaining on a trashy sort of level in the sense that it's best not to think about it too much after you leave the theatre . you can't fault movie critics too much for repeating themselves because it's only due to the fact that films keep repeating themselves and critics comment on what they see . it's sort of like a quarterback who sticks with the plays that work . if it's a winning formula  stick with it and as long as people keep dishing out enough money to see action stars in their repetitive vehicles  hollywood will keep making them . the problem with bruce willis is that he fails to connect in finding a different personality for each character he plays . clint eastwood made dirty harry different from josey wales and his gunslinger in 'unforgiven' was quite different from the drill sergeant he played in 'heartbreak ridge' . all the recent characters that bruce willis has played have looked and felt the same . 1997's 'the fifth element' was like watching john mcclane ( willis' character in the 'die hard' trilogy ) wake up after being in a chamber of cryogenic technology for three hundred years  thawed out to strut his stuff with futuristic bad guys and it failed with most critics except those radical science fiction fans who refuse to knock even the worst of that genre . i really haven't seen willis in a top notch role since his 1994 attempt at serious stuff such as 'pulp fiction' and 'nobody's fool' . i wish he'd go back to the stuff he has the potential with and earn a respectable name for himself but he's becoming a stereotyped performer like sylvester stallone and wesley snipes . the plot line in 'mercury rising' concerns a nine year old autistic boy who has cracked a secret government code which will be used to protect the covert operations of secret u . s . agents all over the world . he got the code from a puzzle book and it just so happens that two government computer programmers put the code in the book on purpose  testing its reliability  knowing ( or at least counting on the fact ) that no one will be able to crack it but not understanding that the human brain will always remain a mystery . their boss  an evil government stooge ( alec baldwin )  is outraged that his employees would pull such a stunt and baldwin takes steps to eliminate all traces of the boy's involvement with the code and the government office that created it . this includes killing the boy's parents and willis plays a demoted fbi agent who investigates the murder of the boy's parents and eventually ends up the boy's protector when things get more and more dangerous . director harold becker ( 'the onion field'  'taps'  'sea of love'  'malice' ) has used his typical style of stretching a story out to be much more than it really is  spreading the plot too thin in an attempt to cover up plot holes and while it hasn't worked for him in the past  it doesn't work here . based on the novel 'simple simon' by ryne douglas pearson and written by lawrence konner  ryne douglas pearson and mark rosenthal  'mercury rising' isn't a film i can recommend for its originality  but it has some decent action sequences as the film is evenly paced and it is touching in a certain way as willis plays the responsible role of the boy's protector and while that may be no big deal to cynics  the film has a style with an average intention to please audiences and because of that it does have some merit .

"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film  you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles  as a master would teach an eager apprentice . "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks  "" he says  "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying  'see you soon . ' "" of course  it's meant to be a parody  but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat  not something you like  not something you enjoy  but rather something you experience . experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses  fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . trust me  you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western  set in modern day japan . a stranger  goro ( tsutomu yamazaki )  comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto )  the proprietor of a small  hole-in-the-wall noodle shop  trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman  pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . goro  to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles  gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen  emerging bloodied  but victorious . goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away  just to eat a bowl of her ramen . the problem is  her fare is something less than popular  and less than appetizing . however  goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest  and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert  enlist the aid of a wealthy patron  and make friends with the former enemy . this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . take  for example  when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . the price is too high  but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . tampopo meets him at his store late at night  and he leads her to a back room . she protests  thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives  but he insists . just when she is about to bolt for the exit  he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day  her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . this scene  while comical  is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation  then of relief and discovery . there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who  despite their economic trappings  are all gourmets and master sommeliers . we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . the scene is meant to bring a laugh  but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor  food is something which everyone has in common  and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film  which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . surrounded by her children  she is obviously in her last hours of life . her husband comes home  and seeing her worsened condition  demands that she get up and make dinner . the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived  and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . in a near miracle  the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal  then brings it to her awaiting family . as the family eats  she looks on them and smiles . preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her  and for a brief moment  she too enjoys the normalcy . then she falls over  dead . for a moment  the family is stunned  but then the father yells at the children  "" keep eating ! this is the last meal your mother ever made ! "" crying as they do so  the family finishes the meal . the scene is comical  awkward  moving  and beautiful . by including the vignettes  itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film  but surprisingly  they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . instead  they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . because the film parodies a western  the construction of the plot is fairly predictable  but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown . in this case  the showdown is against the ramen . if they eat tampopo's ramen  soup and all  tampopo knows she has succeeded . it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be  but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life  you can afford to cut it a little slack .

"filled with a tantalizing air of suspense  with a friend like harry is an unusual yet well-balanced mix of dark comedy  french thriller  and surreal drama . as i was watching the film  i found myself groping for its message at each turn of the plot . its ultimate effect is comparable to claude chabrol's la cérémonie  which  with all its violence and commentary on class delineation . in with a friend like harry  two former schoolmates accidentally meet in a roadside bathroom . michel ( laurent lucas ) is on vacation with his wife claire ( mathilde seigner ) and their three little daughters . he is harried and haggard  far from enjoying this so-called vacation : an endless ride with whining and screaming kids in an un-air conditioned car . harry ( sergi lópez ) is everything michel is not : sleek and self-contained  he doesn't seem to be burdened by anything except good memories and a load of money . within minutes  harry invites himself and his girlfriend  a corpulent  springy bun named plum ( sophie guillemin )  to michel's house -- to reminisce about the good old school days michel himself can barely remember . the success of harry is held in its odd combination of very real  down-to-earth elements combined with surreal devices  creating suspense  disbelief  and intrigue . the film plays skillfully with a common knowledge that there is always a potential danger in bringing an intruder into the family  no matter how stable this family is . at the table  harry recites michel's adolescent school poem with the unattractive title the dagger in the skin of plight  as well as an excerpt from a sci-fi novel called flying monkeys . leading a life of constant gratification  harry is convinced that all michel's problems -- lack of money and the desire to please other people -- have obscured michel's path toward fulfillment as a writer . quick and decisive  harry is a man of action  and his solutions are very concrete . it is nearly impossible to fathom the nature of harry's obsession with michel's early poem  which he remembers by heart . but  as the film progresses  it becomes obvious that harry expresses his obsession through crime . by the film's end  he is comparable to ripley from rene clement's purple noon ( and the american the talented mr . ripley )  a sociopath with an insidious mind learning that he could get away with just about anything . however  harry is a hedonist and a misanthrope  but his enigma is never as refined as ripley's is . the film even treats him with a slight contempt : there is always something distasteful in harry's brisk arrogant walk  in his narrow unexpressive eyes . the music  with sinister ominous overtones  often diverts our attention by accentuating superfluous elements  such as the eggs harry likes to eat after having an orgasm or the vulgar pink wall pattern in the bathroom of michel's house . it creates a creepy and eerie effect  but  after a while  these devices become as predictable as harry's long list of solutions . the movie is not a weighty one  yet there is something in its tension and the way it feeds you its story that attracts you to it . the film seduces you into thinking that  at certain moments  you know where it's headed  and then you realize that you don't . acting is crucial to this film's success  and it is impeccable . michel and claire never get hysterical or grotesquely quarrelsome during their daily rituals . the core of their disorganized and turbulent family unit is established early in the film  and it's clear that no matter what sacrifices michel has had to make for his girls  he loves them without regret or resentment . there is an interesting comment  however  in the closing sequence of the film . just like at the beginning of the film  michel drives his family in the car  only now the car is a present from the magnanimous harry . in a splendid 4x4 sport utility vehicle  with air-conditioning full blast  the kids are content ; no more screaming  howling  or demands . michel smiles -- whatever price he has had to pay for getting rid of harry was well worth it . does the film suggest we all have a little of harry in us ? i think it does . whether it is a point worth making is another question altogether . aka harry  un ami qui vous veut du bien .
