"tristar / 1 : 30 / 1997 / r ( language  violence  dennis rodman ) cast : jean-claude van damme ; mickey rourke ; dennis rodman ; natacha lindinger ; paul freeman director : tsui hark screenplay : dan jakoby ; paul mones ripe with explosions  mass death and really weird hairdos  tsui hark's "" double team "" must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career . actually  in "" double team  "" neither's performance is all that bad . i've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it's just that he's never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994's "" timecop . "" and rodman . . . well  he's pretty much rodman . he's extremely colorful  and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t  even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert . it's the story that needs some major work . van damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn  who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke  all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros' son gets killed in the gunfire  and quinn is taken off to an island known as "" the colony "" -- a think tank for soldiers "" too valuable to kill "" but "" too dangerous to set free . "" quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger )  but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . so  what's a kickboxing mercenary to do ? quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman  kill stavros  save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . with crazy  often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman's lite brite locks  "" double team "" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . but too much tries to happen in each frame  and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what's going on in the movie . and much of what's going on is just wacky . there's a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle  trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn's baby boy ( who's in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers . did i mention "" double team "" is strange ? when it all comes down  this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon  albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity . rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona  though  leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs . but we didn't need "" double team "" to tell us he could do that  did we ? © 1997 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/

"arlington road 1/4 . directed by mark pellington . written by ehren kruger . photography  bobby bukowski . editing  conrad buff . production design  therese deprez . music  angelo badalamenti . producers  peter samuelson  tom gorai  marc samuelson . cast : jeff bridges ( michael faraday )  tim robbins ( oliver lang )  joan cusack ( cheryl lang )  hope davis ( brooke wolfe )  robert gossett ( fbi agent whit carver )  mason gamble ( brady lang )  spencer treat clark ( grant faraday )  stanley anderson ( dr . archer scobee )  et al . a screen gems release . 117 minutes . r ( violence ) the day after i saw this movie  i was reading in the new york times george vecsey's analysis of the us women's soccer team victory . ( vecsey is both a paragon of sports writers and an excellent author of non-sports books  including "" loretta lynn  coal miner's daughter "" the bestseller which became a great movie ) . i quote : "" now the american women are hot  but  then again  america lives for temporary diversion and instant gratification -- new pop groups  new sunglasses  new cars  new internet stocks . "" one might add to this many other items  including new movies  such as arlington road . the following day i received a tbs announcement for a made-for-cable film  first daughter  about the kidnapping of the president's daughter by american terrorists . as voltaire said about god  "" if he didn't exist  he should have been invented . "" hollywood  in the absence of that so-useful big bad soviet bear  predictably turned to world-wide terrorism  including home-grown american destroyers . as in arlington road  an ambitious but disappointing opus . at d . c . 's george washington university  professor faraday ( bridges ) teaches courses on terrorism . he's a widower with his boy  grant . his fbi-agent wife  was killed in a federal cock-up . faraday is being semi-consoled by brooke  one of his graduate students . he lives on arlington road where he makes friends with neighbors oliver ( robbins ) and cheryl lang ( cusack ) . then he begins to suspect that oliver is not the architect he claims to be  but a terrorist leader . . . the film open with the protracted  unexplained sequence . a heavily bloodied  badly burnt boy staggers down a street . just as you think that he'll fall down dead  he is rescued by michael faraday who drives him to a hospital . it's all done as a skillful "" internal "" montage  whose horror  however  does not really hide goofs and improbabilities . item : in a close-up  a drop of blood falls on one of the boy's sneakers . seconds later  the same sneaker has no blood . item : arlington road is a suburban street flanked by many houses and lawns but i cannot remember seeing any people around . it is far too convenient that the only driver who notices the kid's predicament is faraday . item : the child rapidly goes from apparent death throes to a lightning-fast recovery with one arm in a cast as the only visible sign . the explanation of the boy's condition  given by his parents  the langs  is a fireworks accident . all this is an artificial gimmick to have faraday and the langs meet and develop nice  neighborly relations . the couple has a boy  brady  and two girls . brady and grant become best friends . this is held in reserve for future  nefarious purposes . it is also is a gimmick for dis-alienating the orphan grant who disapproves of papa's girlfriend brooke  and for turning the 8-year old into a "" regular american boy  "" a fact that gets worked into the plot . another ho-hummer . michael faraday's questioning of oliver's kosher-ness as a designer of malls starts with his 2-seconds' glimpse of plans that are not of a mall but of an office building . quick eyes  what ? item : when later michael needs to look at those plans by getting into the lang house when the couple is not there  the two little girls who open the door are uncharacteristically pan-faced and suspicious ; michael's excuses for entering are woolly-minded  blatantly dumb . so is his search . item : brooke  rather thinking that michael's suspicions are paranoid  is an unbelievably obtuse naysayer . so is the fbi agent  a friend of michael's . cliche item : when a good person is feverishly phoning about a discovery from a pay-phone  and turns around  the enemy is standing there . improbable item : michael is checking old newspaper files about oliver . . . who suddenly appears behind him . cliche item : the obligatory as well as unbelievable car chase . impossible item : the way chasers and chased connect . goof item : a car is hit broadsides ; next that side is shown undamaged . [here i eliminate about dozens of other items]the finale is highly improbable but does score a point by going against the guesses of audiences conditioned by too many action good vs . evil flicks . i won't disclose it . the script of arlington road-- a name evoking red  white and blue patriotism-- wastes much money and technical talent during its two hours where nothing makes sense . its photography and editing are artsy not arty . story an dialogue go overboard with deviousness and indirection . has no one learned from alfred hitchcock the value of clarity ? . the whole is an alienating mess  and a probably uncalled for stress on large-scale  minutely organized  hugely financed ( but by whom ? ) american terrorism . the movie's events are under the sign of the world trade center and oklahoma city bombings  and the mess at ruby ridge . consciously or not  it connects with such good pictures as the invasion of the body snatchers  the stepford wives  seconds  rosemary's baby  et al .  that is  films where people are not what they seem to be . rescuing it from total destruction are good performances by bridges who is convincing in his pain and obsessions ; by robbins who is smooth and would be frightening if credible ; and by the clever casting of ever-charming joan cusack as a wolf in lamb's clothing .

"the brady bunch movie is less a motion picture than a minor pop event . forget your reruns and forget your nick at nite ; this dead-on recreation of the fabled seventies sitcom is both so exhilarating and * so disturbing that you half-expect to see the ghost of rod serling appear in the narrative . did we really act this way twenty years ago ? of course not . the genius of the brady bunch movie is how it heightens the surreality of the family unit from hell by fast-forwarding them into the future . it's 1995 and greg still calls the chicks "" groovy  "" and marsha still considers hair-brushing the high point of her day . bell bottoms are in  and alice has yet to move out . nothing has changed within the garish walls of brady manor and  so  the plot has the family stepping out into the real world  where they are confronted by everything from carjackers to lesbians . granted  nothing * too * serious happens here . with the exception of some heavy sexual innuendo  the brady bunch movie is about as sanitary as the source material . and that's too bad . director betty thomas ( of tv's "" hill street blues "" fame ) doesn't cut between real-life and brady-life enough to make the contrast as glaring as it should be . the edge isn't sharp enough . * we * know that what we're watching is funky  though  so it's not that much of a problem . nor are the glaring low production standards . the cast is uniformly appealing . shelly long seems to have found her niche under awful hair  while gary cole is right on the mark with dad's sing-song truisms . christine taylor is the best of the brady kids . she's a cheery delight as marsha * and * is a dead ringer for maureen mccormick . her foil is jennifer elise cox  who is a howl as the brooding jan .

"janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there  too . garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular . so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . she soon learns why "" easier said than done "" is the mantra of movies like this . the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland  almost misses the bus to town  can't get a hotel room  ends up in the smallest  trashiest one around  has a dog piss on her luggage  and so on . then comes what roger ebert calls the "" meet cute . "" it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional  cinematic way . in the matchmaker  it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub  his dog sitting at his side . no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage . also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight . that's how it works in movies like these . i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile  then succumb to his charms  live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil  after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet . garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival  during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara . oh  and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability  he dies toward the end . what the message here ? sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction  like garofalo  will sell out with a weak script . i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie  but they actually only have two or three scenes together . leary stays stateside  for the most part  yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . he even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche . both of them should have known better . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1  000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

"i'm going to keep this plot summary brief  something i wish mr . warren had done with his "" film "" ( i know  "" manos "" only runs 74 minutes  but that's not brief enough ) . michael ( hal warren ) leads his family on a trip out into the middle of nowhere . after being lost for a great deal of time  they stumble across a lodge run by torgo ( the late john reynolds )  a small man with large knees . torgo informs the family that he watches the house while the master ( tom neyman ) is away . michael insists on torgo allowing his family to stay  despite the fact that michael's wife  margaret ( the late diane mahree )  and daughter  debbie ( stephanie nielson )  aren't too keen on staying . torgo relents and slowly carries the family's luggage into the house . meanwhile  the master awakens  and his wives ( jackey neyman  sherry proctor  robin redd ) vie for his favor by wrestling in the mud . i'm afraid i'm not an eloquent enough writer to adequately describe the experience that is "" manos  the hands of fate "" . i don't believe i can do justice to this diamond in the rough ; this magnificent piece of filmmaking that is - oh forget it  i can't even say it . "" manos  the hands of fate "" is  arguably  the worst movie of all time . imagine  if you will  the following : hal warren  a fertilizer salesman  bets a friend that he can make a popular horror film on a minimal budget . he hires several actors who have little to no experience or training ( he himself has no experience or training )  and leads the cast through a script which consists of long spells of nothingness occurring . you're no doubt wondering why i have referred to cast members as "" the late "" ; it's because after the film was finished  and the cast laughed out of the theater at its premier  three ( that's right  three ) cast members committed suicide . "" manos "" ( which means hands  by the way ) has since become a legendary film ; one which can only be watched under one of three circumstances : you're completely drunk  completely insane  or completely asleep . while looking over the list of actors involved in this project  you'll most likely realize that none of the names sound familiar . that's because each cast member sealed his/her acting fate by appearing in this "" movie "" . not one actor involved went on to make any other picture . could appearing in a bad movie really do this to one's career ? it's doubtful . for example  barry pepper will no doubt go on to make other films after "" battlefield earth "" ( which is not to say "" battlefield earth "" is in the same league as "" manos "" ) . the chief reason none of these actors went on to other films is because none of them could act . hal warren was as incompetent in front of the camera as he was behind it ; tom neyman made van damme look like an oscar winner ; and diane mahree's part consisted of  well  nothing really . the only two actors worth noting are john reynolds and stephanie nielson . stephanie nielson may have been only a child  but she outdid every adult in the film ( she's no doubt in a mental institute somewhere after experiencing this movie ) . john reynolds  who was sadly one of the three casualties of this war  actually showed some small trace of talent . do i mean he was good ? not in the slightest . yet  i think if he'd received some schooling and experience he might have gone on to a small career . so what does a movie look like when there's no budget ? well  picture "" the blair witch project "" without the scares ( oh wait  there were no scares in "" blair witch "" )  the extras  the scenery  or the nice cameras . you see  "" manos  the hands of fate "" was filmed with such a cheap  ancient camera that the film could only be shot in thirty two second bursts . this means there are fades and/or cuts every thirty two seconds for no reason . the costuming in "" manos "" is rather interesting . there are really only three different bits of costuming : the wives' undergarments  which they wear while fighting each other ; the master's cloak of hands  which is a large cloak covered in large hands ( something involving the god manos  whom he serves ) ; and torgo's knees . torgo's knees  by the way  may look like nothing more than large anomalies stuck to his legs  but they're actually an ingenious invention thought up by john reynolds . torgo is actually supposed to be a satyr  and the large knees were supposed to represent goat legs . i'm not quite sure how reynolds thought this up  and i'm not sure how we were supposed to know they were goat legs  and i'm not even sure why torgo is supposed to be a satyr  but there you have it . there are two more things worth noting in "" manos "" . one is the dialogue  particularly that of torgo ; the other is the soundtrack . torgo's dialogue generally consists of repeating the same phrases over and over again . for example  when asked about the master's health  torgo states : "" dead ? no  madam . not dead the way you know it . he is with us always . not dead the way you know it . he is with us always . "" i think warren wanted to emphasize the fact that he wasn't dead like we know it  but i could be wrong . torgo also states  in a line vaguely ( very vaguely ) reminiscent of a classic line from rosalie crutchley in "" the haunting "" : "" there is no way out of here . it'll be dark soon . there is no way out of here . "" it should be noted that the camera used was so ancient and decrepit that it could not record sound . therefore  all the characters voices were dubbed by four different people : hal warren  hal's wife  and two friends . the soundtrack to "" manos "" is certainly one of the high-points . after some strange and out of place lounge music in the film's opening ( which consists of a lot of driving ) we settle into the torgo theme  which is made up of six notes played over and over again till you're certain your ears will begin to bleed . if i haven't made this film sound bad enough  and you are unfortunate enough to go and witness it  i do apologize . i'd recommend "" manos  the hands of fate "" to those who simply adore classic bad movies ( because this one ranks amongst the worst ) and award it a full one out of five stars . comments ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . netpast reviews can be found at : http : //www . epinions . com/user-elerad ? public=yes or http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? john + beachem * * * * * - one of the best movies of the year . * * * * - great flick  try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie  hits and misses . * * - pretty bad  see it at your own risk . * - see this one only if you enjoy pain . get your private  free e-mail from msn hotmail at http : //www . hotmail . com .  share information about yourself  create your own public profile at http : //profiles . msn . com .

"review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) starring norm macdonald  dave chapelle  elaine stritch  sherman hemsley  daniel benzali  and danny devito the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies  everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends  there is a moment of confusion  then recollection  then some more confusion  then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make movies fun to watch . then there are the bad twists . you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . screwed perfectly suits the latter description . what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . larry flynt  scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . whoops . screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . norm macdonald stars as willard filmore  a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich  old  insidious boss  miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day  willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . too excited to pay any attention  the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends  realizing they can make even more money  decide to stage the fake kidnapping . of course  everything that could go wrong does . the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . the more idiotic these characters get  the more reckless the script becomes . at one point  i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : "" no  you idiot ! "" i'm not just talking about willard and rusty  who were extremely annoying  i'm also talking about the cops in this film . a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . they give real cops bad names . also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns  every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . he just didn't belong in this movie . macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was  gross out humor is certainly not his forte . if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy  dirty work  you might actually love this near-sequel . otherwise  don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money .

"after enduring mariah carey's film debut  glitter  i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker . in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man  rock says  "" you can drive a car with your feet  but that don't mean it should be done . "" to that i say  you can give mariah carey a movie  but that certainly don't mean it should be done . sure  there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . start off with the story  which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . the film is inexplicably set in the 80s  a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . worse yet  everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . meant to be partially autobiographical  carey plays billie frank  a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . influential club dj julian dice  a . k . a . "" lucky 7 "" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro )  hears her sing on a track  and decides to make her a star . in predictably rapid succession  billie and dice fall for each other  she starts hitting it big  dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass  and suddenly billie's on "" the roller coaster of superstardom . "" in the meantime  billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom . i won't give away the ending  but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . . you'll figure it out . the movie screams to be made with camp  and that could've been fun . but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better . what a mistake . the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons . instead  the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes . which brings us to the performances  of which there's nothing good that can be said . mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . she actually looks scared during her one love scene . but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse . so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly . they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons  "" billie  i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making  "" and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says  "" oh  i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "" everyone in the film is a device  and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . to say more would be a waste . there's so much wrong with this film . and  it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days  as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get . but  then again  i had to suffer through her movie .

"here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject  is there a god ? done well  it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema . unfortunately  it isn't . with jumbled messages  and an unclear audience  wide awake was better left asleep . fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died  and joshua has begun a quest . he wants to find god  to discover why bad things happen . this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary )  but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . at his catholic school  his favorite teacher  sister terry ( rosie o'donnell )  tries to give him guidance  but this is a journey he must make on his own . meanwhile  he is having the most momentous year of his life . he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder )  he gets his first crush  and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . on its surface  it appears to be a kid's film . however  it deals with serious issues  and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience  wide awake asks serious questions  but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . if there were a bit more meat in the story  adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell  leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . the nostalgic elements ( best friend  favorite teacher  first crush  etc . ) have been done much better in other movies  and actually seem more like filler here . the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . maybe the film would have been better if  instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks  it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . it certainly would have been more entertaining . wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . it starts out with noble aspirations  but never delivers on its promise . parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first .

"the haunting  -a review by bill chambers ( haunting@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring lili taylor  liam neeson  catherine zeta-jones  owen wilson screenplay by david self  based on the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson directed by jan de bont "" some houses are born bad  "" goes the haunting's tag line  to which i must add  "" some movies  too . "" nothing short of hiring a new cast  a more literate screenwriter  and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel . the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy  and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout "" boo . "" fragile nell ( taylor )  bisexual theo ( zeta-jones )  and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders  hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history . he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew  nell especially  who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants . taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . for starters  her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes  when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . her character is supposed to be depressed  having tended to an unloving mother for too many years  but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame  alternately grouchy  mopey  wiggy and pathetic  and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch . as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones  she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . unfortunately  she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . theo's assessment of the house ? "" i love it ! sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . "" who on earth would say that in place of "" citizen kane meets the munsters "" ? ( furthermore  would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) both actresses fare better than neeson  who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason )  and his character is the most bland . as luke puts it  dr . marrow pulls the old "" academic bait and switch "" on his subjects  but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused . later  he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout "" nell "" repeatedly  given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . why was this nice  helpful  and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . his sets are obsessively detailed  and even before the cgi kicks in  they seem alive  never quite still . i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots  nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor  is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company  no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins  always finish up in locations that were established in act one  as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting  and despite a powerhouse box office debut  i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke  in that it was actually enjoyable  de bont has served up another ride  sans thrill . his images  well-lit though they are  have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact  whole sequences  not to mention the cloaked  airy ghoul who owns the climax  feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back  peter jackson's the frighteners . i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist  i mean to suggest that he's a hack  having found no new ways to give us chills .

"in brief : i think your response to the good son will depend on your response to the question of evil . i found the film excellent--and disturbing . i was uncomfortable throughout . it focuses on one thing--evil--and tries to look at it on its own terms  barring any easy ways out . most of our profs would have said that evil is * really * ignorance  or bad reasoning  or blindness  or unchecked emotionalism  or the result of a bad environment  a terrible childhood  some traumatic event  etc .  etc .  etc . if you think that  then the good son might be a nice little thriller for you  but maybe a little too low-key  too bland . if  further  you think that it's preposterous that a * kid * could really be * evil *  then the film will be still harder to take . but what if evil is a real moral stance  a live threat in human affairs ? what if it is  or can be  a * decision * ? what if it's something that can never be completely removed by education or compassion or prosperity  etc .  etc .  etc . ? ( which is what some of our old-line thomist and calvinist profs warned us . ) to the extent you think that--or at least can enter into the mindset--then the good son will be a disturbing analysis of evil . even if it shows its origin in the genre of the thriller  its main action will be a confrontation with genuine evil in an apparently cheerful  appealing kid .

" 1995  g  90 minutes [1 hour  30 minutes] [comedy] starring : michael roescher ( hank royce )  kristy young ( jinnie sue macallister )  justin garms ( voice of gordy )  james donadio ( gilbert sipes )  written by leslie stevens  jay sommers  dick chevillat  produced by sybil robson  directed by mark lewis . "" gordy "" is not a movie  it is a 90-minute-long "" sesame street "" skit  and a very bad one at that . this movie is so stupid and dumb that it's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light  and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . i'm sure children are the target audience of this movie  but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms )  whose family has been taken away to "" up north  "" which we know means death . of course we can hear the animals talk to each other  and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible . actually  it's almost funny in a way . the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears  a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it . what is the point of this ? maybe she is one of the producer's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something . we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating . he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue  but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah  didn't see that one coming ! )  starts to drown  and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him . if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank's grandfather  the original ceo  dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . . and gordy ! of course there must be a villain  but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn't that evil . he never raises his voice or becomes angry  and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story . it's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film  or if the filmmaker's are just this untalented and stupid . at times "" gordy "" is tolerable to watch  thus earning it one star and not the dreaded "" z- . "" but it's just so unbelievably boring  cliche  dumb  unfunny  corny  and just plain bad it may scare children  it certainly disturbed me .

"" obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment  and so to finish us utterly  they have now released "" urban legends : final cut "" . this is another "" scream "" -like feature  consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time . amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do . but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize  a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine )  whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines . soon enough  fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow  and amy is being chased around by scary killer  while her cast and crew get slain  one by one . is the culprit the original urban legends murderer  just some random psycho  ! a member of the faculty  one of her competitors for the hitchcock  or is there something even more stupid going on ? this is another one of those tiring  pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary  funny  or interesting . it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain . the body counts and screams continue to grow  as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly . in fact watching films like that after having watched "" scary movie "" is impossible keeping a serious face . several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing  without succeeding . and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing . it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century . how many times must we tolerate the same clichés that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ? it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them . they are the most stupid  meaningless  predictable and soulless films in existence . however  director john ottman manages to make "" urban legends : final cut "" into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre . what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in "" scream ""  ottman takes seriously . for that reason alone  it is worth a look  just to realize how bad a movie can be . it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement  and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect . even movies like "" lost in space "" and "" mission to mars "" seem spectacular in its shadow . we have not seen such waste of t ! ime and resources since "" showgirls "" ( 1995 ) . no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production  i came up with nothing  except the way the killer was dressed . here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu  that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask . jennifer morrison ( "" stir of echoes "" ) is all right  and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script . in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools . if these graduates will be the directors of the future  then hollywood's golden days are over . rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment . let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend .

"" girl  interrupted "" argues that mental institutions keep the sane and release the unstable  because of stuffy procedures and restrictive rules written by bureaucratic doctors disconnected from reality . while i am sure these things are true  the film never makes us care  because its heroine is a bitchy little nut-job . "" haven't you ever confused a dream with reality  stolen something when you had the cash  or thought your train moving as it sat in the station ? "" she pleads with us in the opening scenes . but that's not the kind of behaviour she's being locked up for . this is a young lady who responds "" what ? "" whenever anyone asks her a question  drifts into daydreaming in the middle of sentences and thinks it's perfectly acceptable to guzzle great quantities of pills and vodka . her name is susanna kaysen  a real-life figure whose book this movie is based on . if the film is anything to go by  i'm lucky that i never read it . "" girl  interrupted "" is a pathetic example of someone denying she's in denial ; it's as stupid as sylvia plath's "" the bell jar "" without the engaging style . there are journal entries in the film we're supposed to accept as profound philosophising . most of them are just the kind of pretentious stream-of-consciousness drivel that many teenage girls write  only to look back on years later and cringe with embarrassment . the story is set in the 1960s -- boys are being shipped to their deaths in vietnam  and susanna ( winona ryder ) thinks she's got a hard life because her mother is hassling her about going to college . after a suicide attempt  she is encouraged to sign herself into claymoore  an expensive mental hospital where the head nurse ( whoopi goldberg ) gives a straightforwardly accurate diagnosis : "" you are a lazy  self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy . "" susanna does a lot of mellow lying around  drunk on her own superiority  convinced she's "" artistic "" rather than crazy . fellow inmate lisa ( angelina jolie ) offers her support  probably because the two women have the same problem -- thinking they know the secrets of the universe  when they're actually defective jerks . other friendly faces include a pathological liar ( clea duvall ) and a girl who likes to set herself on fire ( elisabeth moss ) . anyone in a position of authority  or who displays the least bit of conventionality  is portrayed as an uptight white-collar conservative square . i am reminded of "" reality bites "" ( 1994 )  another film starring ryder in which the alleged heroes were self-obsessed layabout losers . "" girl  interrupted "" is moronic and arrogant crap  not least because its obnoxious onscreen behaviour is accompanied by a voice-over that asks  essentially  "" can you believe these stuffed shirts thought i was obnoxious ? "" perhaps the book or true events would lead me to a different conclusion  but the susanna kaysen of this film could use a good hard slap in the face . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantganiplease visit  and encourage others to visit  the uk critic's website  which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic

"some movies  while not totally bad  just piss me off . roger kumble's lame excuse for a drama cruel intentions fits perfectly into this category . loosely based on the famous novel "" les liaisons dangereuses ""  "" intentions "" tells the story of sebastian and kathryn valmont  two wealthy new york step-siblings who are the cause of lots of damage . sebastian ( ryan phillippe ) has a reputation of promising women the world to get them in bed  and then dumping them . kathryn ( sarah michelle gellar )  equally evil but more inconspicuous  is also manipulative  in the way that she helps out with sebastian's games . in the first of many plot contrivations  kathryn bets her brother that he cannot devirginize annette ( reese witherspoon  phillippe's real-life girlfriend )  daughter of their new school headmaster and self-proclaimed virgin till marriage . if kathryn wins  then she gets sebastian's car  and if sebastian wins  he gets to bed kathryn  the one woman whom he supposedly can't have . well  anyway  although sebastian is cruel to the fullest sense of the word  annette can't help but fall for him . i mean  damn  this guy is manipulative ! from that point the film just spins way out of control  juggling a subplot featuring a teenager ( selma blair ) also getting involved in their schemes . the movie then goes for cheap melodrama and any cliche it can think of . none of the film's characters are at all real  and none of them make any decisions that a normal human would make . although many sexual cliches are added in just so that teens will have a little fun  this film is another case where the trailer is more fun than the movie . i mean  with a cast like this  the producers did not need to make a good film in order to ensure that every teenager in the world will see it . but i wish they at least tried .

"loser  -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring jason biggs  mena suvari  greg kinnear written and directed by amy heckerling * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films  director amy heckerling's latest  loser  seesaws between unpleasant and artificial  and is sometimes both at once . when she tackles big issues  such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high  it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness )  but whatever the case  she continually refuses to comment politically . such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button . this fear of drama soured me on fast times . . .  look who's talking  clueless  and now loser  in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates  for the first time  zero affinity for the milieu . has anyone  for instance  ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ? attired in black thrift  her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips  she accepts the label of goth  but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging  as dora does  those geriatric rockers everclear  nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger . the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity  so that they become even less than stereotypes . they become walking wardrobes . small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs )  our eponymous hero  always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears  and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream "" shemp "" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder . he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers  but they share similar facial features  including and especially mouths )  and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . though they're not overtly transvestites  heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her . ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged . dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions . unfortunately  either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . ) when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare  he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) . although paul's already in love with dora by this point  as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name  he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott . she's thrilled  but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( "" cabaret "" )  and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way  she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend . cue precious hommage to the graduate  shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . . ( aside : simon & garfunkel's "" parsley  sage  rosemary & thyme "" should never have been allowed in another motion picture . ) heckerling has a lot in common with nora "" you've got mail "" ephron  the only other prominent chick directing comedies today  in that neither has any use for strong-willed women . men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene  she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum )  and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned  she's cheerily redecorating his apartment . ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) goth veneer aside  there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora  and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model  and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility  it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes . ( consider  too  that dora is the film's sole female principal . ) not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn't . that is her hallmark .

"" call it whatever you want  but certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- "" hush "" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago )  the latter of which appears to have given "" hush "" a send-off that's downright infuriating . it's too bad that "" hush "" is so laughable  because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at . paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson  a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy  well-to-do family's horse farm/estate kilronan . jackson's mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself  and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether  caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be . but it seems that martha's friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she's what you'd call someone who loves too much . martha eagerly  deviously wants a grandchild  and then helen will be expendable  as far as she's concerned . if there's one reason to catch "" hush  "" it's lange . she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated  injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field . when she delves into martha's dark side  predictable cliches -- chain-smoking  staring in mirrors  praying in a confessional to a priest who isn't there  poking a hole in helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound  but it's moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch . veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother . the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable  especially paltrow . but can you really blame them ? the character relationships in "" hush "" hold a certain amount of promise  at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity . idiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( "" why did you yell ? "" helen yells back at martha )  and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . you can see through a great deal of martha's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? if any of her potential victims thought  acted or behaved like normal people  "" hush "" would be a really short movie . and then there's the climax and ending  which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses . after a really weird chase scene  martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . i won't spoil what happens next except to say that it's contradictory  illogical and ( probably  since i'm no doctor ) medically impossible . the final scene offers no closure  no resolution  no confrontation whatsoever . it's just there  dangling amidst silent displeasure . no one should like this ending  regardless of their feelings on the preceding material . perhaps "" hush "" 's title is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .

"" on wfil-tv's american bandstand  regulars on the show started imitating the black kids and claiming the dance steps as their own . mann's interview with bandstand dancers joan ( buck ) kiene and jimmy peatross attempts to illustrate how the white mainstream ripped off the african- american culture . as a political message it's too simplistic ; mann lingers on their shallow repetitiveness and misses the opportunity to make a major statement . most of the information presented in twist isn't new--the fact that rock and roll was considered to be a "" communicable disease "" under eisenhower's presidency  for example--but the section on the twist itself is informative and well-structured . in 1959  ballard's recording "" the twist "" took the nation by storm . twisting was easy ; you just moved your hips . as legend has it  dick clark assumed that the song would be too dirty coming from ballard  and it didn't show up on bandstand until the cleaner-imaged chubby checker recorded his version in 1960 . a year later the dance had become a world-wide sensation and the song returned to number one  spawning over 300 twist spin-offs . it was probably the first time those immortal words "" it's got a good beat and you can dance to it "" were spoken on prime time tv . at a new york club called the peppermint lounge  manhattan's rich and famous were rubbing shoulders with the commonfolk to get in on the action . for a brief moment the film becomes quite fascinating ; we learn how influential the twist really was  starting fashion trends and saturating popular culture . if only the rest of the film could have maintained this momentum . unfortunately  mann follows this portion of the film with a downward-spiraling epilogue that simply flings more contrived dance floor maneuvers in our face . the swim  the jerk  the watusi--all less successful derivations . the hully gully and the hucklebuck ; imitations that paled by comparison . when the british invaded in 1964  one kind of musical hysteria was traded for another . for all the shimmying and shaking going on in the film  twist is amazingly lacking in energy . the archive footage is varied and often fun ( a clip in which marshall mcluhan shares his thoughts on the dance craze  for example  is a howl )  but mann does very little with it . many scenes lack continuity . after a while  the frenzied black-and-white footage of teenagers bopping and jitterbugging becomes repetitive and ultimately boring . it's hard to tell the fly from the frug  the millie from the monkey . even though twist runs only seventy-eight minutes  it's a long haul . it's not clear whether twist is supposed to be a celebration  a tribute  or a condensed history lesson . as a simple account of dance styles from the fifties and sixties  it's poorly-conceived ( it would have made a fine short film ) . for all its instructional aspirations  twist doesn't know when to lead and when to follow .

"" the film's title must refer to the impatience of the kids to leave adolescence for maturity  as well as to the state of english in schools . following the seniors' graduation ceremony  their class has the usual ritualistic bash--in the home of a girl who ought to have known better than volunteer the place . the party is a rite of passage --not the rites of spring but the trites of spring . the motto  as in other such events  must be brew and screw . for its characters  the filmmakers round up the usual suspects  all of them types found in the teen genre . if there is some originality here  it is well-hidden by cliches gathered from earlier flicks . chw's deja vu types and actions make up a pot-pourri  an expression where "" pourri "" means "" putrid . "" but this epithet would be too strong a condemnation of a movie whose main guilt is total superficiality . the action almost entirely takes place at the shindig . celebrants range from geeks to nerds to jocks to cuties . without a central plot or guiding thread  the whole thing is just a collection of skin-deep subplots . the main one is this : athletic mike  the bmoc  has just dumped amanda  his girl since freshman class  as part of "" game plan "" with his pals . the idea is that those among them who are going on to college will have women by the regiment falling into their arms and beds  so why not break with the boys' current liaisons ? it's not only a dumb idea but a revoltingly cynical one . learning this  college-bound would-be writer preston wants to declare his love to now-uncommitted amanda . he is a likable  shy fellow who has been adoring her silently ever since they both were freshmen . in a flashback to four years ago  the movie goofs by showing amanda  preston and others looking exactly as they do now . add to this the sin that hollywood has been committing since silent movie days and in many contemporary films as well : too many screen students --high-schoolers or undergraduates--are perceptibly older than they would be in real life . preston comes to the party with his confidante and best pal denise . she is brainy a la janeane garofalo  even looks like a mix of garofalo and a young kathy bates . she lacks confidence in her own appearance  is outside the girlish loop  critical of others  has a mordant tongue . another subplot will involve her being accidentally locked inside a bathroom with seth  with predictable consequences . he is a white boy whose solution to having an identity has been to adopt a black personality in dress  speech  manners  music  and the like . ( there are  by the way  some merely token minority students at the party ) as for amanda  she's been a kind of first lady all along  queen of this and of that . she is nice but  like almost everyone else  not a thinking person . ( you wonder how the vague preston will perform as a writer ) amanda does get the film' s main profundity when she realizes ( and confesses a bit pathetically ) that all her glory came from being mike's satellite . with some people  it takes time to see the obvious . i will not mention other characters  events or gratuitous developments of chw . the partygoers  are without exception not just undeveloped but undersketched . there are few small saving graces . one is the movie's relative briefness . even though the title calls for the joke i could hardly wait for it to finish  i did not find it unbearable -- just blah . another is that preston is neither depicted as pathologically shy nor as a caricature intellectual . there are no drop-dead gorgeous women . and  in a near-surreal sight  as preston tries to use a public phone  a woman  a tired stripper with fake angel wings  hassles him for the use of the cabin . she is played by the uncredited jenna elfman  who recently had a major part in krippendorf's tribe and is married to the nephew of composer danny elfman . obviously made for high-schoolers who may or may not get some mini-shocks of recognition  and full of references to current pop culture  chw will survive only if its target audience shows up .

"" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls  "" "" road house "" and "" showgirls "" in the bad movie hall of fame  but it'll do until something worse comes along . the film  adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel  "" waltz into darkness "" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film  "" mississippi mermaid "" )  opens in a turn-of-the-century prison  as jolie's character  slated for a dawn execution  tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like  "" this is not a love story  it is a story about love . "" wary of local gold-diggers  cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america  listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . a practical man  luis chooses a frumpy looking lady  hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . imagine his surprise when his fiancée  julia russell ( jolie )  turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . julia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face . luis then confesses his deception  leading julie to state  with great significance  "" we have something in common  we are both not to trusted . "" after their wedding  luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking  with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun  although the filmmakers' insistence on using one of banderas' legs to cover jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her . luis  the stupidest man who ever lived  immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia  despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . luis must force julia to write to her sister emily  who is frantic over her lack of communication . shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird  it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . finally  when she cleans out his accounts and disappears  luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . incidentally  if you're afraid i'm giving too much away  rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie  leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists  a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . along the way  private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane  who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie "" 61 * "" ) turns up  hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real julia . luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist  having decided that if he can't have her  he will kill her . oh  the pathos of it all . the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story  adjusting their performances accordingly . banderas is suitably impassioned  while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips  she can really pout ) . as for thomas jane  he starts off acting suspicious and cagey  then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . his most startling moment comes when  to prove his power to humiliate  he forces luis against a wall  verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape  show them this chilling scene . and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler  show them "" original sin .

"yes  august is upon us and with it comes the second appearance of the twice-yearly dumping ground for hollywood . like the february doldrums  august brings us films filled with fading stars and awful storylines that weren't deemed good enough to break even after a big summer marketing campaign  nor will they be able to go toe to toe with meatier fare during oscar season . and to open august  enter bless the child  possibly the worst movie i've seen this year . well  after mission to mars . swallow hard before reading this ridiculous plot synopsis  which i can already tell is going to be painful to type . in a nutshell  jesus has returned to earth in the form of a little girl ( holliston coleman )  who is abandoned by her druggie mother ( angela bettis ) as an infant  to be raised by aunt maggie ( kim basinger ) . six years later  satan's minions are out to kill the girl  of course . and this year  satan's head minion is a new agey creep named eric stark ( rufus sewell )  determined to convert the jesus girl to the dark side before easter . . . or else she must die ! ( i guess they picked easter because  you know  they missed the whole millennial paranoia genre window by about a year . ) enter an occult-expert fbi agent ( jimmy smits ) and you've got a kind of cop-thriller-paranormal sixth sense wannabe that makes apocalyptic pap like end of days look like the seventh seal . while young coleman is a gifted actress  the movie has her doing little more than beating her head against the wall  hugging people  or spinning stuff with her magical powers ( backed up by lousy digital effects ) . basinger proves that  yes  l . a . confidential was a total fluke and that she can't act after all . and sewell appears to be channeling dr . evil for his goofy bad guy role . while christina ricci is being used to sell this film to the unsuspecting masses  her part is barely a cameo comprising three minutes of screen time . but bad acting doesn't kill bless the child  it's the bad plot that aborts this production . driven by randomness  coincidence  and just plain stupidity on the part of the characters  the movie wanders from scene to scene with little more purpose than filling 100 minutes before we get to the inevitable showdown at the end . this has been a successful m . o . for action films for a century -- but few have had the gall to try to work in a god vs . devil plot . the film is so over the top that maggie's car  when falling off a bridge  can't just splash into the water -- it has to explode into flames on the way down . the film is so derivative it actually steals lines from other movies ( notably a slight variation on "" the greatest trick the devil pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist "" from the usual suspects ) . and the film is so amazingly obvious that you expect stark's limo to have "" 666 "" on the license plates . altogether  bless the child is almost bad enough to become a cult classic .

"" simpatico "" doesn't involve us in its story  so much as it blackmails us into it . yes  i kept wondering what was going to happen next  but not because i cared -- i simply wanted to make sense of it all . the film's method is to throw a lot of bewildering information at us  and keep us watching by promising it'll all be sorted out by the end . the main characters are carter ( jeff bridges )  a successful businessman whose acres of property include a sleek country mansion  and vinnie ( nick nolte )  an angry slob whose rotting bungalow lies in the middle of sandy nowhere . as the movie opens  carter is getting ready to sell his family's prized racehorse  but is interrupted from the deal by a phone call from vinnie  who orders him to come cross-country to see him . carter immediately hops on a plane . with the possible exception of hugh grant  millionaires don't often abandon their busy schedules to visit shady bums  so what strange hold does vinnie have on carter ? after a lot of unspecific talk about 'the past ""  we learn that years ago the two men were involved together in gambling and bribery scams  and vinnie has always held onto proof of these illegal actions that could destroy carter's credibility in legitimate circles . since vinnie is more than a little unstable  carter does not want to upset him  and appeases his old friend as much as he can . we get the sense that this arrangement has been going for quite some time -- vinny making threats  carter giving him things to keep him quiet . things may not  however  be so simple this time . vinny is really starting to act like he'll do something with his evidence ; perhaps he'll expose carter  perhaps just re-open old wounds for the man's wife rosie ( sharon stone )  whose part in her husband's extortion rackets left her permanently emotionally scarred . right there is  more or less  the whole story of "" simpatico ""  which unfolds in an odd manner : characters pop up onscreen now and again talking about secretive things the audience don't know anything about . flashbacks appear  to explain tiny pieces of the puzzle . then come moments of quiet reflection . while this deliberately perplexing method of storytelling must have seemed like a hot idea to the filmmakers  because it lets them stretch their meagre plot out to feature length  it leaves the audience at a loss to understand whether or not the actors' performances are any good . we're never let know what the motivations of the characters are  let alone whether these motivations are being played convincingly . nolte and bridges do a lot of grunting and shouting ; stone appears far too late in the film for her passionate anger to redeem the dullness of the script . albert finney  playing a man vinnie and carter ruined  does a lot of weird babbling in a typically terrible american accent ; catherine keener  as a checkout girl who never wanted to be involved with a bunch of crooks  switches between tough cookie and gullible simpleton  often within the same scene . maybe all this made sense in the sam shepard stage play upon which "" simpatico "" is based . it doesn't in the movie . this would have been a fascinating piece of work if the plot had been outlined in the opening twenty minutes  and the rest of the script had focused on the characters . who are these people ? who were they ? how do they feel about each other ? how did the consequences of their swindles specifically affect them ?

"_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school  and now they cannot hold regular jobs . but as the trailer goes  "" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . "" so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy  but for a film called _dirty_work_  what ensues is rather clean of spirit . in fact  what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine  but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant  and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list  his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50  000 to pay off his bookie . so for all the scheming that goes on  beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a heart  which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is  but of a different sort . there are frequent sexual references  most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them . and for a film rated pg-13  director bob saget ( yes  that bob saget  of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano  fred wolf  and macdonald himself  stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one  but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . but the issue  of course  is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in  is it funny or not ? the answer is a resounding no . it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy . he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing  and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural  likable screen presence . he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch  but  for the most part  the oneliners  as written  are flat  and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . still  macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . the late chris farley  as hysterical as he ever was  is amusing in a cameo role  but  as a whole  the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman  adam sandler  and john goodman  but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . the film closes on a sad note of desperation  an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . come to think of it  i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ .

""" my problem was being a young man with money in manhattan  "" says bret easton ellis  citing his inspiration for american psycho . when it comes to vivid fantasies of alienated urban narcissism  his prose strikes a chilling  edgy chord . like skimming the surface of an icy lake  we are left imagining the dark depths below . hey  that really sounds poetic ! i'm gonna have another valium before writing the rest of this review -- maybe someday i'll be as glib as ellis ! just kidding . i've actually enjoyed reading ellis' novels of passive emptiness . less than zero is the perfect book for road trips  especially when you look out the window having thoughts that resemble the shallow characters . "" ah  yes  adolescence truly is a volatile mystery ! "" having said that  ellis prose typically comes off as  well  boring  glib  pseudo-intellectual  snooty  irritating  and shallow when read aloud . try reading passages to your friends . watch them lose interest in you as a human being . don't scoff ! if you were in their shoes  you would  too ! heck  you probably will if you attempt to sit through gerald fox's unintentionally grating documentary  this is not an exit : the fictional world of bret easton ellis . fox tries to pull off the imaginative conceit of crossing interview footage of ellis with dramatizations from his body of work  including less than zero and his recent perils-of-celebrity bestseller  glamorama . it's like a kaleidoscope of short films with additional commentary from the novelist . unfortunately for ellis  he's so smug  creepy  and annoying that he does his novels a disservice by appearing onscreen . potential readers will take one look at this privileged brat and understandably vow never to read him . i haven't even started discussing ellis' whiny friends  hogging for screen time as they take a limo cruise through new york city searching for the perfect restaurant . it's scary that his unimaginative fictional characters bear such a scary resemblance to his actual peers . when one of them compares him to orson welles ( "" cuz you're a big genius  bret ! "" )  i wanted to slap that pompous grin off his mug . okay  maybe i'm jealous that i don't have ellis' problems . beautiful friends  a fat wallet  the inability to see through my own vapidity . maybe i'm being too hard on the guy . gotta calm my nerves before i finish this review . pass the cocaine . a bottom-of-the-barrel budget doesn't help illuminate the scenes lifted from ellis' novels . rough  jarring cuts and washed out cinematography are completely inappropriate for the polished world his characters inhabit . the bland white walls and inept lighting could have been easily better-realized by inexperienced first year film students . the poorly staged ellis stories serve as a reminder of how right mary harron's instincts were on american psycho . by dwelling on impeccable art design  tailored suits  embossed business cards and designer glasses  she found the precise visual counterpart to ellis' hyper-detailed take on consumer culture . bored  introverted characters with zero empathy can be compelling on the page  but it doesn't always translate to the screen . christian bale's mannered performance as psycho's killer patrick bateman was appropriately deadpan . would that declan thurman ( uma's brother ) showed such restraint filling the same role in exit . he blows line readings with a distracting assortment of eyebrow and lip twitches . see  i'm really crazy ! there's nothing hammy about ellis' sparse writing style  so why can't thurman resist maniacal laughter when describing a girl's head on a stick ? by discussing the "" meaning "" of his books  ellis only winds up reducing them to facile morality lessons . he also eats up screen time defending his prose from vicious critics  often protesting far too much for comfort . i don't hate women ! american psycho is a feminist tract ! less than zero was not autobiographical ! it's a sensationalized version of my post-college years . this vain little man seems to care an awful lot about what people think of him . oh  go ahead ! try telling him that and he'll retreat back into a banal shell of doublespeak . as one critic points out  it's almost impossible to discuss ellis' flaws without him embracing them as part of his integrity . of course it's shallow  of course it's nihilistic ! that's the world he created . see how slippery he is ? what was that great bill murray quote from rushmore ? "" money can buy a lot of things  but it can't buy you backbone . take dead aim at the rich kids !

"directed by : andrzej bartkowiak written by : eric bernt ( i ) and mitchell kapner cast : jet li  aalyah  delroy lindo  dmx mpaa : rated r for violence  some language and brief nudity . runtime : usa : 115 in our time . in our modern world  where the cool rule  it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . and yet - film after film  after film  is based on his everlasting magic . in warner brothers' latest production  shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat  while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet'  its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york  is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . the afro-americans are immediately suspected  but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . escaping from a prison in china  he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks  he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . and there are more problems besides its title . of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . we call it 'modernization' . it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics  without any car chases and gun fights . this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated  because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . and as long as love  hate  honesty and corruption do exist  everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak  since it is his first attempt at directing . he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . his latest picture is therefore visually impressive  but intellectually hollow . the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah )  and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . their achievement save this film from being completely braindead  but they are not actors  and therefore can not act . they are nothing more than two celebrities put together . the other actors  including isaiah washington  russell wong  henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . but there's more than acting to worry about . even with li's incredible skills in martial arts  the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller  not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet'  so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . and in the end it's nothing . there are no performances worthy of notice  no interesting character- or story surprises . so again  the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . this film can boast of great sound  fast paced editing  solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . it is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists  that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . but when i think back  it's not much i remember from this 'production' . as in almost every summer movie  there are some interesting scenes  but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities  simply because it doesn't have any . for someone who has never read shakespeare  it's another popcorn film . for those of us who has  it's a waste of money  time and brain cells .

"fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies  but the quantity . most of those movies were produced by cannon group  company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman  b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends . unfortunately  that didn't happened  and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade  behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage  that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal . sadly for bronson  that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead  and lowering his own reputation in process . on the other hand  bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular  especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself . one of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3  third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . in the original movie  bronson played paul kersey  mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence . that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet  in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) . unfortunately  six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality . death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend  living in the urban wasteland of east new york  populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out . before the reunion  kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy  probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) . kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade  while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter )  ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime . bronson  the main asset in this movie  plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine . although bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower )  the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film . the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness  so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade . on the other hand  emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding  yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks  and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey . unfortunately  michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot  and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations  ends this movie with a bang . the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie  because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . in short  this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis  the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) .

"year : 2000 . starring jim carrey  renee zellweger  robert forster  chris cooper  anthony anderson  mongo brownlee  jerod mixon  michael bowman  traylor howard  tony cox . written by peter farrelly  mike cerrone  and bobby farrelly . directed by bobby farrelly and peter farrelly . rated r . it seemed like the perfect concept . what better for the farrelly brothers  famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter  than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness )  throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . jim carrey's signed on too ? even better . the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening  claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality  labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia  "" and so forth . such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would  of course  only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire  proving that some people just couldn't take a joke  and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . yes  it all seemed perfect  but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny . it's not for lack of trying . the farrellys utilize in "" me  myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites  a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver  decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . this  of course  means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature  making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . soon enough  charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second  independent personality named hank  a deep-voiced  boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted  or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted  and the film runs off its tracks . some have suggested that this isn't a problem  because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . they're wrong  of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort  1996's "" there's something about mary . "" ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project . ) the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe )  but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . in "" mary  "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way  then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . "" me  myself & irene  "" by contrast  seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness  missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary  "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment . the brothers pile on the offensive humor  taking shots at race  midgets  albinos  mental illness  and all manner of bathroom jokes . but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of "" me  myself & irene "" comes off as rote  by-the-numbers  adolescent comedy . the plot  with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger )  who's in more trouble than anyone knows  back to new york  has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go . ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? yeah  me too . ) the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters  and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do  no matter how outrageous their actions might be . compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing  this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed  presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value  it's no longer funny  merely gross . the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . take  for example  the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson  mongo brownlee  jerod mixon ) . the incongruity of it all is funny for a while  with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . but by the end of the film  they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another  funnier level  and it hasn't been dropped either . that's too bad  because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . "" me  myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities . there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality  and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions . this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on  so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called  appropriately  "" whitey "" )  but the script doesn't go anywhere with it  instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . jim carrey is a gifted comedian  both physically and vocally  but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me . "" it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting  but none of it is terribly funny . carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull  and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy  but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . irene is nothing in particular  as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy  clever  or neither . as such  she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film . chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent  and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . he  like the others  does absolutely nothing unexpected . after viewing the shapeless mess that "" me  myself & irene "" eventually dissolved into  i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . if the farrellys are indeed good  smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are )  they'll rebound just fine . even after that happens  though  i'll still consider "" me  myself & irene "" to be a high-caliber misfire .

"miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . you see  'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news . no  the mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit  that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer  at least ) franchise . something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber )  the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott  sidney's mother  is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . ( once considered a danger to society  weary now hosts his own talk show  "" 100% cotton ""  a clever  if dated  jab at american pop culture . ) of course  a new ghostface dials him up  and  with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind  we immediately wonder  where is the killer ? the backseat ? the next car ? thrilling prospects  to be sure  but actually  ghostface is at the weary residence  waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . what's missing from this sequence  and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly  the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes  one of which might spring to life )  is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . our other surviving regulars have become estranged . sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks  while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie  "" stab 3 ""  and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . murder reunites them  as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 ""  imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death . the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend  your classmate  your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery  with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next  but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . ironic self-reflection aside  parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . with scream 3  the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some  but the character remains conceptually potent . conceptually . the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky  because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying "" all bets are off ! "" in reference to the "" rules "" of a trilogy's third act  but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating . with the departure of kevin williamson  who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that  for reasons incomprehensible to me  was ignored  save the notion of "" stab 3 "" )  kruger needed to be reined in tighter  and by wes craven . craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies )  akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . it pains me to write this  but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless  with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart )  jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 )  and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . the visuals are much weaker in part three  as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . ( aside : in the wake of columbine  craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony  when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) finally  marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent . sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here  they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe  the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels  scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish  and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : part three must disappoint' .

( aside  club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn't changed in the future . ) one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences  specifically the newsreels of the future . hysterically funny  actually . but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between . the storytelling lacks focus  to say the least . the politics of the film are scary . the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos . there's even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out  nude  with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater  just the way he seems to like it . i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i've encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo  he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders . of course  verhoeven's probably the one to blame  and perhaps i'm jealous because i'm so disgusting . at any rate  a movie called starship troopers shouldn't be about sex . exactly ten years ago  verhoeven made robocop  which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving . and r-rated  despite its goofy premise . maybe it's asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie  then-he's a master of insipid violence . however  ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it .

"an alan smithee film : burn hollywood burn  -- so bad it hurts to watch for more movie reviews and trivia  visit http : //www . joblo . com/plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film "" trio "" from the studio  after they complete the "" final cut "" without him . he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision . critique : wow . i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels ! the "" comedy "" in this film is pathetic  obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) . the plot is uninteresting  boring and bad . the structure of the film is annoying  repetitive and pretentious . the acting is pretty bad  especially jackie chan  who can't act to save his life . the cameos are lame and seem forced  and the ending blows chunks . all in all  this movie believes itself to be a clever  humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood  but comes across as a boring  stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite . i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans  but this one bites the big one . see it if you like to watch really bad movies  otherwise skip it  because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it . luckily for us all  this mess only lasts about 80 minutes  and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective . by the way  is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ? who knows  who cares  this "" satire "" sucks the bag . little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically  the original director of this film  arthur hiller  also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker . this was after the film's production company  cinergi pictures  preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his . the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis . eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack . he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him . he received 9  200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists  listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack . this film practically swept the "" razzie awards "" in 1999  given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year  with no less than the "" worst picture "" award  the "" worst screenplay "" ( joe eszterhas )  the "" worst supporting actor "" ( joe eszterhas )  the "" worst new star "" ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the "" worst original song "" ( "" i wanna be mike ovitz !

"see this review as it was intended at : http : //www . jaxfilmjournal . com/cast : faye dunaway  helen slater  hart bochner  peter cook  mia farrow  marc mcclure  brenda vaccaro  peter o'toole  matt frewer written by : david odell directed by : jeannot szwarc running time : 124 minutes / 138 minutes * * * the following review contains spoilers * * * "" it's just . . . the way . . . we are . "" --- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked  an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl . i'll admit it . . . i love superman iii . i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor  but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise . supergirl  a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind )  doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality  let alone superman or superman ii . supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time . as the film begins we see the residents of argo city  a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space ""  go about their daily lives . ok . . . what ? so these are exiles from krypton  which blew up right ? were they living there before krypton exploded ? how do you get to "" inner space "" ? this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained  particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . how do they know where superman went ? how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . one day the founder of argo city  zaltar ( peter o' toole )  gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin  kara ( helen slater )  for use as inspiration in her art . kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city . in the chaos  the omegahedron sails out through the opening  dooming the argonians to death . . . in three days time  or something . kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who  immediately before her dip was ruined  announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans  and she sets out to achieve world domination . selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth  and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . ok . . . huh ? why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? attention movie : explain yourself ! i'm sorry  i can only suspend disbelief so much . i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . knowing that she needs a secret identity  supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle )  picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . she's given her dorm assignment  and who happens to be her roommate ? lois lane's sister  lucy . ok  coincidence is one thing folks  but we're getting really contrived now . what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason  of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense . there is some credit to give to the film however . one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done . also  its commendable to see genders reversed in the film  whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest  a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments  when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars ) . then there were numerous little things that bothered me . the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . instead of having her look like she's flying  the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful ""  so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . also  who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise . there is also some rampant product placement in the film  most notably for popeye's  tylenol  and a&w root beer  with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . finally  just one word : monsters . faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully  however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! "" at one point ) . dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better  with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies . helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent  naive character she's written to be  as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . believability aside though  it's still annoying . now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles )  leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested  but excited about its release on dvd ! they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd  to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . yet i'm still unclear as to why  since this movie is so awful ) . the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1  is enhanced for 16x9 televisions  and has been remastered in full thx glory . extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and "" special project consultant "" scott michael bosco  the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! )  5 trailers  3 tv spots  talent bios  in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie )  and assorted still galleries . the transfer on this international version is incredible . . . you'd think you were watching a new release . images are sharp  colors jump off the screen  and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . only some special effects sequences show the wear of time  and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) . the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places  however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) . the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track . bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen  and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . although  at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc  and is surprised when he doesn't get that response . we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track  most notably the "" almost "" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . as it stands  superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . for the sake of brevity  i won't even get into that one . szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own  replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy "" whimsical fantasy "" nonsense . bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along  claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . again  for the sake of brevity  i won't even get into that one . anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50  000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film  which runs 138 minutes long . the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note  except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono  but fans of the film won't care . one question though . . . shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . i was nine when it was released to theaters  and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . i knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before  but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence  which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . at the end of the film  supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron  and flies back to argo city . ugh  i give up . i'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once  not twice  but three times to review these discs . supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package  but a very lousy movie .

"as the twin surfer dudes  stew and phil deedle  lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital  phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother . yanking out his iv  he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother's face . this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles  a movie more to be endured that watched . ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening  since every time i did  she'd start sticking her finger in her throat . and she's right  it is that bad . ) directed without any imagination by steve boyum  whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction  the film limps along at best . boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts  stunts and more stunts . amazingly for someone with his background  he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones  and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . but who's counting ? and then there is the script by james herzfeld  whose only other film  tapeheads from a decade ago  was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . meet the deedles  however  is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes "" your geyser's a geezer  "" and "" i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack . "" as the movie opens  the twins  who at one point describe themselves modestly as "" a walking kodak moment  "" are celebrating their 18th birthday . as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki  a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire  the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men . as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone  they've got their surfboards  skateboards  and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . their camp has gone out of business  but they are mistaken for new park rangers . the rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger  played by dennis hopper  who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration  scheduled for later in the week . hopper  who has made some wonderful movies  carried away being a recent favorite  does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . this isn't his worst acting  but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in . steve van wormer and paul walker  as stew and phil  give lifeless performances . the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . to add insult to injury  hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups  which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen  and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families  one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . they make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt . "" how could this possibly be worst  "" asks phil . just when you suspect it can't  the movie takes a turn further downhill . its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . after phil's girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil  they suck in a long worm . like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp  their lips finally meet in a kiss . as they pull back  their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas  both almost 9  gave the show * * * . they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep  and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo .

"" ready to rumble "" is one of those films that tries to be funny  but sadly fails miserably  everything in the film is imcomprehinsable  and even the trailer wasn't funny . the actors are dull  the script awful  and the plot which there isn't much of . . . . really annoying . i'm not quite sure how great actors like these  and very funny actors too  are given such a lame script  and directed in such a childish manner  that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days . this review isn't going to be very long because of the fact that there isn't much going for the film  if anything at all . only one big laugh is in the film  which isn't all that hilarious . i sat in my chair wondering with this 107 ( ! ! ! ! ! ) minute "" comedy "" was going to be over  and sadly it went on forever . i'm not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste  but believe me you  it is . reviewed by brandon herring 4/29/00 for more reviews please visit movie review central at http : //www . geocities . com/moviefan983/moviereviewcentral . html

"release date : april 9  1999 starring : katie holmes  sarah polley  jay mohr  scott wolf  desmond askew  taye diggs  william fichtner  nathan bexton directed by : doug liman distributed by : sony pictures entertainment / tristar pictures mpaa rating : r ( strong drug content  sexuality  language  some violence ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/go . htm filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull  dreary  and overused idea . doug liman ( swingers )  director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go  is an example of just such a filmmaker . in his latest  he gives the viewers a raucous  neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level  bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view  much as an author might write a serial novel . consistent with this ethic  liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . neither of the three stories have much substance  and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . ( in fact  the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting  and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite  and performances from little-known players like polley  askew  and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles . in fact  even bigger names like mohr  wolf  and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success . although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time  the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . go doesn't have this  and it suffers because of it . as far as teen movies are concerned  go represents the absolute bottom  for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals  people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers  people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives  or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) at times  the humor in go is sickly funny  and on a low night  almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers  this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .

"director :   kirk wong cast :   mark wahlberg  lou diamond phillips  christina applegate  avery brooks  bokeem woodbine  lela rochon screenplay :   ben ramsey producers :   wesley snipes  warren zide runtime :   us distribution :   sony pictures/tristar rated r :   violence  language  sex by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) i didn't hate the big hit  even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . for the entirety of its running time  my eyes were attached to the screen  and i never once got bored . i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . as a narrative  the big hit is pure garbage  never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank  which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . it's fine to mix genres  if the film makers know what they're doing . unfortunately  writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material  and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . the biggest problem with the amalgamation  in this case  is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . but it sure is a fascinating failure . marky . . . er  mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley  a hitman . he's a good hitman  apparently  although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips )  crunch ( bokeem woodbine )  and vinnie ( antonio sabbato  jr . ) . they're a nice bunch of muscular guys  who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks )  who is rich  powerful  and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this  of course  is where the plot comes in . they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow )  who has a rich father . when they do this  it turns out she is paris' . . . goddaughter ! it's very bad to have paris against you . the story is standard action film stuff . it's nothing new  and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers  which are both far superior ) . there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . melvin is also very good at breakdancing  and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . like i said  it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy  as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . then  as soon as they go to their first hit  it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . then  somewhere in between  it turns back into comedy . keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene  she is forced to read a letter out loud  indicating that she has been kidnapped  but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . and scenes like this work alone  but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious  or not be in the film at all . one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there  paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it  but they let him out of there  telling him to find the perpetrator . the scene is played for laughs  but it isn't funny . and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy  it tries to fall back on the action  which also fails . this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . characters betray each other without a second thought . grenades are thrown in tight places . people jump out of tall buildings and survive . people outrun tumbling cars  and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . most frustrating of all  though  is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle  quiet  and skilled individuals . they're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage  including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . the acting is kind of fun  though--wahlberg is a good actor  and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character  while christina applegate  who plays melvin's fiancée  is convincingly air-headed . the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . the funniest parts are supplied by the actors  and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . it's a true disaster  one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . despite all this  though  i must reiterate the entertainment value here . you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is  you just might enjoy yourself .

"in the first death wish movie  mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey  played by charles bronson  was avenging the death of his wife . in the second  he was avenging his daughter . in the third  he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . fourth movie  on the other hand  begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen  played by kay lenz . however  since this is death wish movie  we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . kersey's new targets  unlike the previous movies  aren't the ordinary street punks but rich  heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support  and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan )  determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . white's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . the plan begins to take shape  but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . fourth ( and  unfortunately  not the final ) installment in the death wish series  will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group  production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . however  although some critics might argue  death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey  one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s  is still being dumbed down by mediocre script  and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting . however  the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal  although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence  and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional  like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics . ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi  the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files  could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) .

"here we've got a really rare bird : a film so stupid it can't even make fun of itself properly . you know a culture is in trouble when even its trash doesn't stick to your mind . spice world may not be the worst big-name movie ever made -- i'm divided at this point between species ii and money train  with north in the running -- but it's not even a good crummy movie . it's just crummy . i kept begging for a moment of some halfway genuine wit -- a mistake  a sneeze  a sense that they just grabbed something and ran with it instead of staying with the script . no such luck . that script  by the way  plays out like something they scratched onto a soggy cocktail napkin at a producer's party . comparing this movie to a hard day's night would be a sinful mistake . a hard day's night was conceived as a quick exploitation package to cash in on the beatles' popularity  but two things happened : one  the beatles stuck around and became more important than anyone could have guessed ; two  the movie was brilliant . neither exception applies to this film . we get performance segments which are flimsy and witless  padded with revue-type material that doesn't garner a single chuckle  and fistfuls of stuff shoveled in that dates the movie horribly ( like a dumb x-files gag  complete with halogen flashlights ) . the girls are also disturbingly untalented ( again  unlike the beatles ) -- there's five of them bleating away up there  and collectively they don't even add up to one good singer . who are these girls  anyway ? despite their variegated appearances and hairstyles  they're one indistinguishable pulpy blob . what frightens me the most is that like so many other junk-food culture artifacts aimed at the younger set -- the teenage mutant ninja turtles or the power rangers -- there aren't any real individuals in the group . there's just this kind of amorphous  composite personality that they pass around between them  like the three crones in greek legend who all shared one eye . i hate reading a great deal into pop-culture phenomena  but if the spice girls send a message of any kind  it's twofold : that it's better to subordinate your personality to a premanufactured group identity  and that trash not only sells  but aggressively seeks its own level . santayana once bemoaned america's love affair with trash  and he noted that it wasn't the trash that bothered him  but the love . he film's most telling moment : immediately after a performance  someone tells the girls  "" that was perfect -- without actually being any good . "" imagine that . a moment of genuine insight  in the middle of this movie . maybe there is a god .

"perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it  it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . written  directed  and produced by one of its two stars  stanley tucci  whose last picture was the indie smash hit  big night  the impostors almost never catches fire . sputtering like a two-day old campfire  the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . the film's other star  oliver platt  was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth . the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent  including woody allen  steve buscemi  hope davis  alfred molina  campbell scott  lili taylor and tony shalhoub . all are wasted save allen  who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . ) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles  the movie engenders little genuine laughter . the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . the plot for the movie involves two starving actors  maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci )  who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina )  who is chasing them  they dress up as ship's stewards . the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . when the leads hide from their pursuers  arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . at other times  we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else  while darting in and out of staterooms . with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage  it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment . the jokes  frequently framed in silence  fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies . surely  if they had  they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones  but  if they couldn't pull it off  they should have just given up . "" the show is over for this fella  "" steve buscemi's character says towards the end . the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning . there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . the impostors runs 1 : 42 . it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . email : steve . rhodes@internetreviews . com web : www . internetreviews . com

"directed by : william friedkin written by : james webb and stephen gaghan cast : samuel l . jackson  ben kingsley  tommy lee jones  guy pearce mpaa : rated r for scenes of war violence  and for language . runtime : usa : 128 as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment  hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved  by telling stories and expressing opinions . this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels  hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . they fought side by side in vietnam  where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow . that's against the rules of war but understandable  in this story anyway  under the specific circumstances . certainly hodges is not complaining . years pass . hodges  whose wounds make him unfit for action  gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . childers  is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . because of his excellent record  childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley )  cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire  he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . more than 80 yemeni men  women  and children are mowed down . childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? or are there simply no rules in war ? the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious  but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . the murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? where is the u . n . ? the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? this film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . these accusations are pretty heavy  but also unfair . what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility . the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now  but is overdone  contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . that is precisely why it's not offensive . it is completely unobjective . many stories are started and never finished . many questions are asked  but never answered . a lot of parallels are referring to nothing . it seems that neither the director  producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . is it about arab mentality ? america's foreign policies ? america's role in the world ? corruption in the higher circles ? it goes on and on . it consists of countless stories  but not a definable plot . it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . i think that it is ironic  because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story  but became a rather effective film . in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes )  his latest film does simply not engage . i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . the characters feel designed  unreal  merely shadows  with no life outside the conflict . even the actors can not save this film from going under . though both jackson and jones act admirably  with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this  it is not something that these great actors can boast of . they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . jackson is gray and jones uninteresting . the rest of the cast  including ben kingsly  blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . the time has come for the verdict . on the charges of complete lack of objectivity  i find this film guilty . on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking  i find it guilty . but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty  because of it's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere  not only when concerning the arab population . i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far  portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . this is very sad  since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . however  it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . and that it's not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east  including yemen are on constant maximum alert .

"by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) dear god  this is a fantastically bad film ! regardless of what i say about knock off  you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . you have to see it and experience it for yourself . here's the kicker  though -- i suggest that you do so . yes  this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . in fact  i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time  despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon  michael wong  paul sorvino  and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . it does  however  have the entertaining presence of rob schneider  and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . as i watched it  i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . now  in retrospect  it seems clear that it wasn't  but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is  by far  the most boring part of writing a review )  but  in this case  i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . for the sake of comparison  i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . i paid closer attention to knock off  and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray  and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are  of course  products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts  but there are lots of martial arts in the film . ray is good at martial arts  so when he has to beat up bad guys  there's no problem . rob schneider plays his sidekick  although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff  while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! in fact  every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . in that order  knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . but what a strange mess it is . it was written by stephen e . de souza  who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . can this be the same man ? i don't see how  unless  of course  huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go )  but there's no semblance here . for instance  van damme is introduced  and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . why ? who knows . what are the implications of this ? i have no idea . most action films abandon depth in favor of action  and this is normally a problem . knock off  however  is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon  in particular  delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . sorvino  in addition  deserves better than this . van damme is bad  but he's charming in that bad way  and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . the only exception is rob schneider  who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . they're all pointless gimmicks though  such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy  such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? i hope he did  for the alternative is a frightening thought . knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . if it were boring  i'd give it zero stars . but it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . it's also funny  even when it isn't meaning to be funny . a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness  but i can't deny it's zany  useless charm . oh  i know  they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story  but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this  but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is  indeed  awful .

"an attempt at florida film noir  palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels . it's slow moving  uninvolving  and plain just uninteresting . harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man  just out of jail after being framed for a crime . his luck hasn't been the best  but things are looking up when a mysterious woman  rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue )  approaches him with a proposition . she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter  odette ( chloe sevigny )  pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500  000 out of her stingy  but rich  husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) . at first  all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone  and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . but  as the deed is carried out  things are not what they seem  and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm . palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film  but the effect never quite comes together . it's got the sultry florida heat  seductive women  and even curvier plot twists  but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . sure  the right ingredients are there  but the end result is much too artificial . a lot of the problems lie with the script  which  though providing some genuine surprises  is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations . even the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story . some of them  for example  come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer  or the whole typewriter situation ) . the characters are mostly lifeless  played to type  but not much more . woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist . elisabeth shue vamps it up  but doesn't add anything special to the role . chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance  trying to be a sexy 17-year old  but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth . some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger  but  in the end  meaningless performances . and to top it off  the pacing of the film is much too slow . as the movie grinds to a halt  you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it watching palmetto . if you're in the mood for this type of movie  you'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .

"i must say that i wanted very much to enjoy welcome to the dollhouse . i'd watched the trailer and laughed hysterically at each line . however  in its full theatrical version  this film is a complete failure . dollhouse definitely has its moments  but mostly this film spent its time flip-flopping between attempts to be satirical and poignant--often failing . writer/director  todd solondz  unfortunately has no ability to pleasantly mix the two sides it seemed he wanted to express . the impression i had of the writing was that the draft used wasn't very far from the first one . everything was presented as is  there was not one ounce of subtlety . dawn weiner  the young girl who's life is pure torment  at one point calls a bully a retard . later  the bully  brandon  takes dawn to a junk yard where he plans to rape her . instead  he tells her that his brother is retarded  implies his feeling were hurt and they start a relationship . as written  this scene was pulled off in the worst way possible because it suffered severely from clichi-itis . brandon's character steps up to the fence  into close-up and makes his declaration  "" . . . he's not in any grade  he's retarded . "" todd solondz assumes we'll start to feel brandon's pain  however the scene is too contrived toward that expectation and it proves that solondz thinks an audience will react to 'sad scenes' like damned  pre-programmed machines . as a director  mr . solondz is rarely competent . too often do we watch actors move for the camera . as in the scene i described earlier when brandon walks to a close-up by the fence . this technique kills any possible sense of reality within the performances because we are too aware of their staging . i have long been of the opinion that actors are not a tool to serve the camera  but the camera is the tool to capture the actors' performances and even to add to it . all to often  i think  directors stage their actors in service to 'the shot' when they should be doing the opposite . a great example of this is glengarry glen ross . if you watch  you'll notice that director james foley is moving his camera  not his actors  for effect . the performances in the film are usually pretty good with a few exceptions and there's really not much to say here other than a few of the actors deserve the attention this film will bring--specifically dawn weiner  her mother  her brother  her sister and even steve rogers . lastly  there was a moment in the film where dawn goes to new york to find her little sister . she goes to sleep and suddenly wakes up to see a man running down the street with her sister screaming under his arm . i remember thinking at that point that because this film had already lost all integrity  this dream sequence actually did tricked you only because something this ridiculously inept was possible within welcome to the dollhouse . and it is for reasons like this that i think todd solondz did a horrible job as both writer and director . he seemed desperate to shake our views of teenage life--to be an iconoclast--but fell into clichi  which i despise . this film won best picture at the sundance film festival and like the brothers mcmullen last year  they both proved that independent filmmakers can make films as cliched as hollywood can .

"wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . over black and white drawings  we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange  sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation . the "" original "" inhabitants of the earth  fairies and elves  return to populate the globe  along with their evil  mutant counterparts . one day ( and i say "" one day "" not to be trite  but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice )  a fairy queen gives birth to twins  one good and one evil . the twins grow up to be powerful wizards  the good one embracing magic  and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . as unoriginal as the premise is  i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world  after all . i soon learned  however  that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . once the transition was made from still art to color animation  an entirely different feel takes precedence . rather than the epic saga promised by the narration  we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon . not just the look  mind you  but all the zany sounds like >honk< and >boing< when the characters go jumping around like . . . . well  like cartoon characters . when we see blackwolf  the evil twin wizard  he's pretty much what we expect . the good wizard  avatar  is nothing like he is depicted in the opening . rather than a sagely master  he's more like george burns  complete with stogie in foot . that's right  he holds it between his toes . he doesn't even look the like he did in the black and white drawings . how disappointing . papa smurf and santa claus are serious wisemen compared to this guy . i imagine yoda picks guys like avatar out from between his teeth on weekends . for years  blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good  since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined . however  blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . yup  adolf hitler  the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . okay  not the real things  but an archival film his minions dug up . projected into the sky for all to see  it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . before you know it  there are dead elves everywhere . this is just as well . the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them . they're either silly  sappy  or both . the dialog gets much of the credit for this . an example is when avatar nonchalantly says  "" well  looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . "" not very formidable when he's also the guy who says  "" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on . "" my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil . her response is  "" they have weapons and technology . we just have love . "" suffice to say  the characters are strictly two-dimensional  and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen . which it does . the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out  which is anticlimactic and disappointing . please note that it is the action that is unexpected . that it is disappointing is not . the film couldn't settle on a particular mood . it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity . the dramatics  which seem to occur at random  are overly staged and overly acted  detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned . ralph bakshi  the director  makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . so who doesn't know this already ? well  maybe children . okay  so you might say that this is a movie for children . it's not . in the scenes where good fights evil  there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon . so is the film for adults ? if so  we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point . why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes  and hitler giving speeches . however  we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad . we see no atrocities being committed  not even any real battle footage . there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich  and we're not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place . this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made  since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . i'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere  at any time  and we must therefore be vigilant . however  i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit .

"starring-david arquette  scott caan  oliver platt  rose mcgowan  diamond dallas page  bill goldberg  joe pantoliano and martin landau director-brain robbins canadian rating-14a released by warner brothers - 04/00 an 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch  wearing tight-fitting leather  as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch' . two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them . and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch . welcome to `ready to rumble' . judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion  you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes  there is an audience for this sort of thing . ladies and gentlemen  i weep for society . mind you  when executed with style and comic ingenuity  jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny . unfortunately  `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers  nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired . `ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling . . . . which  in fact  sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy . but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves  and limited to a stampede of asinine  humdrum bathroom humor  basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome' . gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics . by day  they transport raw sewage . by night ( particularly on nitro' monday )  they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt )  the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community . with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance  gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand . but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano  sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans . sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp  thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans . gordie and sean are shocked  rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! ' they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt . along the way  you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well . you may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself  or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies . i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is  if its fresh and resourceful . `rumble' is nothing but a sloppy  frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation . the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience . luckily  the simple-minded events pick up steam  particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action . director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues'  and when in the ring  he does professional work . but the violence is too excessive . having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year  especially with one character's dive during a cage match . this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of . outside the wrestling action  the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term scattershot'  while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10  with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on . the final tally : i chuckled a few times  groaned a lot  and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 . casting-wise  `ready to rumble' is an odd duck . oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ? he's perhaps a bit chunky  but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty'  which dampens the blow i suppose . rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls  ' proclaims gordie )  but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg  `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others ) . wcw fans are sure to appreciate these . others . . . well  won't . i found merit in david arquette's bountiful energy as gordie  which brings me to my finishing . . . . ahhh . . . . `praise' for the film : in `ready to rumble'  i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette's `at&t' television commercials . now there's a low blow for you .

"what do you get when you rip-off good movies like woody allen's bananas and martin scorsese's after hours ? you'd think you'd get the best of both films . instead you get woo . falling in somewhere between def jam's how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok )  woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african-americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons . the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours  as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goes out on a blind date with straight-laced tim ( tommy davidson ) . mayhem follows them . for some unknown reason ( read : contrived screenplay ) davidson puts up with all of woo's antics for the entire night  which include her destroying his bathroom mirror  stealing things from his house  violently questioning him ( accusing and belittling him actually ) about previous girlfriends  causing a riot in an elegant restaurant  and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn't tolerate . but for the sake of this bad movie ? sure  why not ? there are a few chuckles in the film  the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas . in this case  davidson is running from thugs  gets into a subway car as the doors are closing  starts to taunt the thugs  then the doors open back up again . a good joke  but a stolen one . another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams' cameo as himself . movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so  and not one of them has ever been a hit . woo won't be one either . so why was it made ? and more importantly  isn't there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive ? everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point .

"if there is one universal rule in hollywood  it is that all successful movies will have a horde of clones following close behind . such is the case with "" i know what you did last summer "" . a cheap  predictable  pathetic excuse for a slasher movie  it tries to follow in the footsteps of wes craven's highly entertaining "" scream "" with disasterous results . four teenagers celebrate their graduation from high school in typical teen age fashion . they drive to the beach  get drunk  and head back only to hit someone on the road . they then choose to dump the body in the sea  make a pact never to mention it again  and go on with their happy little lives . a year later  they begin receiving threats and are eventually attacked by someone who claims to know what they did the previous year . i'm going to keep the rest of this review very short  because i don't want to go off on a two hour rant about how awful this movie was . first  let me point out how completely devoid of anything resembling a scare this film was . second  if there is one thing i simply cannot stand it is long chase scenes which drag on for at least twenty minutes only to end in the exact way we knew they were going to before they started . third  and final  i'm not going to reveal who the killer is  but if i were to tell you  it would hardly be classified as a spoiler since the character is only introduced at that point . the only reason i gave this piece of garbage an extra half star is because of the performances of the two female leads . they both try valiantly to add something to this pitiful excuse for a horror movie  and i commend them for their effort . do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one . i give it a measly star and a half . * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever  see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie  hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you've got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain . e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com

"directed by troy miller . cast : joseph cross  michael keaton  kelly preston  mark addy  henry rollins  andrew lawrence . 1998 - 95 minutes . rated pg ( for sexual situations  mild profanity  and mature themes ) . reviewed december 13  1998 . by dustin putman  ""  dustin putman's film reviews  "" http : //members . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html "" jack frost  "" is one of those dumb  corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film  but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . this does not come as a surprise  since the studio that made it is warner brothers  who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife  gabby ( kelly preston )  and 11-year-old son  charlie ( joseph cross )  but doesn't spend nearly enough time with them . when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play  he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . halfway there  jack has second thoughts  but on his way back home  is in a car accident and dies . switch forward a year  christmas is approaching once again  and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack's death . when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died  the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack's spirit . jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him  but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . "" frosty the snowman  "" is a classic cartoon  and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated  but as a live-action film  it doesn't work at all . after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established  "" jack frost  "" quickly goes downhill  especially once the snowman comes into play . since jack has been deceased for a whole year  you would think there would be many questions to ask him  such as  "" what happens after you die ? "" or  "" how does it feel to be a snowman ? "" but instead  the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . the performances are respectable enough  but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this . michael keaton at least got off easy  since he disappears after the first twenty minutes  but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? i have always liked kelly preston . she is clearly a talented  charismatic actress  but has never been given a good role in her life  usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character  as in  1997's  "" nothing to lose  "" and  "" addicted to love . "" joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast  since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . in one of the only subplots that actually works  due to its wittiness  henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side  however  by the tried-and-true main plot at hand  which is the sappy story of a father and son . since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around  i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid  cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : "" you da man  "" says charlie . "" no  i da snowman  "" replies jack . or how about this little zinger  coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : "" snowdad is better than no dad . "" do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? the snowman  created by john henson's creature shop  is more believable than the snowman from last year's unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick  also called  "" jack frost  "" but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . either way  it was an awful lot of work to go through  just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . as a seasonal holiday picture  "" jack frost  "" is pretty much a clunker . a better christmas film from this year is  "" i'll be home for christmas . "" better yet  my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film  such as  "" it's a wonderful life  "" "" a christmas story  "" or  "" prancer . "" "" jack frost  "" is an earnest  but severely misguided film  and children  as well as adults  deserve better . i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent  anyway .

"happy gilmore is one of those movies that you assume was intended as a comedy  but you don't laugh . it's one of the most disquieting films i've seen -- not because of what it showed  really  but because it assumed that everything it showed would automatically be found funny by its audience . take  for instance  the title character  as played by adam sandler . sandler is one of the most charmless people to ever step in front of a camera . like so many other "" comic "" actors today  he assumes that if people laugh when someone raises their voice to a roar  people will really fall apart laughing if he raises it to a pavement-splintering bellow . more is not better . happy gilmore is a kid with a hockey fetish and what some counselors would probably call "" an anger control issue "" . he can't play hockey to save his life  and this enrages him . constantly . then he discovers  quite by accident  that his bad hockey playing translates into great golf playing  and soon he's taking part in a tournament that promises to help pay for his grandmother's back taxes . how interesting is any of this ? not very . it's only made worse by the fact that the one gag in the movie is happy's temper tantrums . if this were a serious movie  it would be something along the lines of cobb : about a dangerous sociopath who is only redeemed by the fact that he can channel his aggression into a socially acceptable form . here  it's a lame clothesline to hang a bunch of extremely uncomfortable scenes masquerading as comedy . here's the thing : take these psycho-behavior scenes out of this movie  like the one where happy smashes a beer bottle and goes after his golf rival  and you'd have the pieces for a completely different story -- maybe one of those paul schrader films  like taxi driver or rolling thunder  about tormented loners who take out their anger on the world around them . but instead the same ingredients are used to make a comedy  and the result is ugly and unsavory . why is any of this supposed to be funny ? after the credits rolled  that was the only thing that stayed with me . that and adam sandler's shrill and unlikeable screen persona  who on the basis of this film i won't be interested in seeing ever again .

"a review by jeremiah "" spassvogel "" rickert i've always been a kevin kline fan  silverado  fish called wanda  pirates of penzance  and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances . the minute i saw the trailer for this film  i resolved to see it . besides the fact that kline starred  it looked like a hilarious film . i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent  however  as i also thought  "" wow  if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer  there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . "" ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . ) the film began . . . . the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school  named howard brackett . he loves poetry and great literary works  but his class is more interested in his famous former student  played by matt dillon . ( i'd put in his name  but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it . ) they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him . brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years  and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her . the wedding  however  becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual . kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't . the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference . his closest friends don't help matters  bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party . there are some genuinely hilarous moments  one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity . kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck  who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out  while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations . the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding . kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . . if you want to be surprised  don't read  i am going to reveal the ending . . . . instead of saying "" i do "" in front of his parents and most of the town  and even some cameras  he says "" i'm gay . "" this is where the movie  in my opinion falls apart . most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight  while at the same time  loving poetry and being a senstivie guy  dressing well  and occaisionally acting prissy . it reminded me of the "" effeminate heterosexual "" sketch from saturday night live . it was funny  it was sustainably funny  and kline's performance made it doubly so . however  after the wedding  the film drags on . they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion  but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done . he reconciles with his parents and his friends  some of which had turned on him . there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time  the scene with his mother and her friends  which was hilarious  seemed pointless  and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless . finally  even though i am not catholic  i found the scene with the priest to be condescending . the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship  proclaiming to brackett in the third person  "" he's gay . "" it got a chuckle from the audience  but i was distracted by it  and began to tire of the film . by the time the wedding had come and gone  i found myself hoping it would be over soon . ( much like this review you are saying ) overall  if i have to quantify it  i say  rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets * 1/2 out of * * * * * . see it in economy time .

"deep impact ( 1998 ) rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language  starring : tea leoni  robert duvall  vanessa redgrave  elijah wood  morgan freeman . ---------------------------------------warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . but it doesn't really make much of a difference . deep impact begins the official summer movie season  and it also brings back memories of 1997 . remember when dante's peak came out in february ? a few months later  volcano was released . the first film was smart  exhilirating  and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . well  it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . this time  unfortunately  the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon  the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . of course  the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine  and so i am in the minority  as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak . but while watching deep impact  i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . apparently many did  and it utterly baffles me . to be completely honest  i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo  but it was still rather fun to watch . deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities  it also contains cheap human drama  incredibly horrible special effects  and a poorly constructed plot . the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future  but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater  pushing it back to 1993 ) . a line of students is outside at night  peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . leo unknowingly discovers a comet  and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer  who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . he races off to mail the information  but is killed in a reckless car accident . a year passes  and nothing is heard about it again . we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( téa leoni )  a reporter for msnbc . she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . after talking with rittenhouse  and unsatisfied with the information she gets  she decides to use the internet for help . luckily  she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . before she can use the information  the government decides to push her car off the road . they take her in to meet the president of the united states  president beck ( morgan freeman ) . beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . naturally  she wants to be compensated  and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . and so  yada yada yada  they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . they announce a plan called "" ark  "" which is their only hope for survival . a computer will select 800  000 people at random . these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race . after two years  the dust will settle ( actually  it would take much  much longer--approximately ninety years  from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures  but there is one subplot worth mentioning . jenny and her father  jason ( maximilian schell )  have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . now  of course  we all know that the comet does impact the surface . the title alone suggests it  and the previews actually show it ! by doing this  absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work . director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er . "" her major film debut was the peacemaker  a pathetic and heartless action film . well  this time leder outdid herself  creating a film worse than that one . suggestion to ms . leder : please  stay away from the big screen  or at least the action genre . much of the blame can be placed on leder directly  because the pace is disastrously off . throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring . of course  leder isn't all to blame for it . screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know  you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" ) and stupid characters  you might think we were back in the 70s again . only one of the subplots is remotely interesting  while the rest are forgettable and boring . and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action  drama  or sci-fi . to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . that's right  80% miss  and 20% hit . scenes above the earth are well done  and the orbiting ship is majestic . but the comet is a huge mistake  making it more laughable than frightening . the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough  but that's forgiveable . what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . give me a break  will ya ? and of course  the much hyped collision of comet and earth . well  it is far from spectacular  and it makes independence day look brilliant . the water rushing towards the land is effective  but once it hits the continent  the effects turn ridiculous . cgi water is used  and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . in fact  i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . just when we think visual effects can't be improved  along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction  which also influences the actors . leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror . this reminded me of another action director  renny harlin ( die hard 2  cliffhanger ) . but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces  but instead of coming off as sympathetic  leder seems more of a sadist . one moment has an astronaut flying off into space . this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience  but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space . this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience  and i  for one  am not going to be fooled . on another note  leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . the pace does pick up  and some very emotional moments are shown . then again  when you watch people cry for their loved ones  it's obvious it will be emotional . it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into "" feeling "" for the characters  but it didn't work for me . but anyway  the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . téa leoni ( bad boys  tv's "" the naked truth "" ) is the best of the film  and she is given the meatiest role . her character is made stronger by leoni's presence  and we grow to care for her . robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch  but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . elijah wood also comes off rather successfully  but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood  stick to drama ! you are too talented for this stuff ) . vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable  and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . maximilian schell is distracting  but he does provide some nice humor . morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this  and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . leelee sobieski could have been better  but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . eldard is good in his role  but is limited by the plot . crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's "" star trek : the next generation . "" seeing her was one of the highlights of the film . overall  a very talented cast virtually wasted . deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . this is one of the worst films of the year  and if it is any omen of things to come  this summer could be one of the worst ever . luckily  the x-files movie is coming up  and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much . costing nearly $75 million  with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker )  and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic )  one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . well  it's not . when the comet does hit the earth  you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .

"deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie . this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises  and  being true to its title  being deceptive . but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit . braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) . their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth )  a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket . however  a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators  as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables . braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives . braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn )  a local bookie . kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette )  believing his wife to be unfaithful . the plot is twisty and complex  with lots of lengthy flashbacks  and plenty of surprises . however  there are times when it is needlessly complex  and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost . take a look at l . a . confidential  or the film's more likely inspiration  the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled . the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot . for example  the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender  or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear )  but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable . there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation . they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay . the characters  themselves  are rather pathetic and despicable . not one of them is an ounce sympathetic  and as a result  the labyrinthine plot is all for naught . what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ? writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple  or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound . but  while they have got the plot twists down cold  they need to work on characterization and dialogue .

"some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others  almost as gifted  have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . as was amply evident after basic instinct  sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . rejecting her natural abilities  she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . gloria is her latest disaster . babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity  and neither should stone reject what she does best . janeane garofalo  for example  is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . gloria  directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes  was not screened in advance for critics  almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened  it is clear why they held it from the press . it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . as the story opens  an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents  a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam )  nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . "" be a man  "" his father lectures him sternly . "" don't trust nobody . not no broads . nobody . "" most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . add in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing  and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . ( "" say you're my baby  "" kevin coos demandingly . "" i'm not gonna  "" gloria pouts back . ) the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared  no matter how many people are after him with guns  trying to kill him . and in one key scene  the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . gloria  who keeps saying how she hates kids  takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? if you don't know the answer  you may be just the right viewer for this film . you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid  she says with utter seriousness  "" you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do .

"written by : e . max frye ( based on the james hadley chase novel just another sucker ) starring : woody harrelson  elisabeth shue  gina gershon  chloe sevignysynopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post  tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye  has ill-timed fits of coughing  and fails at everything he does . the story is told from harry's point of view . harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink . one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue )  who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn't smoke . seduced  harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny )  the teenage daughter of a rich man . turns out  it's all part of a needless  very puzzling  extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry  a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post . when the 'kidnapped' odette is found dead  the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer  and the police are hot on harry's trail . harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money . can he get out of this mess ? opinion : palmetto is a long  uninteresting film with all the wrong feel . hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence . this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof . but palmetto is played like a dark  serious  detective noir drama  and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction . there's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts  buttocks  short skirts  colored painted nails  and women's legs . even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema  you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue's breast forming a prominent foreground . towards the end  palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators  with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals' confession . if you can imagine 'shemp' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo 'lingerie suspense' thriller  that's how out of synch this movie feels .

"i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through  but i had to make an exception with powder . i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house . so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie . but i can at least get a partial review out of it  because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place . the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house . when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him )  social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? gold bond ) to a state home  where we find out he's a different from the other kids . actually  we find out he's different when we first see him  because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever . when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie  the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son . "" obviously . all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago . so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids . that is  until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass . "" decisions  decisions . . . ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table . so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy  his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character . and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes  as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i . q . test went straight off the chart !

"mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film  so you should know what to expect . a weak plot  terrible dialogue  very little acting ability  but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . however  mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts  and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . jackie chan plays  who else  jackie . this time out  he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . not that it ever makes a difference in the plot . there are only two scenes of him cooking . for the rest of the film  somehow he mutates into jackie chan  supercop . it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? a tv newswoman  diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick )  covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs  the demons . although she only has one camcorder  somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm  shades of broadcast news ? ? ? anyway  the goons discover diana  and will do anything to recover the tape . here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? oh well  no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . as luck would have it  diana runs across jackie  and  wouldn't you know it  jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences  the film uses english as its primary language . however  that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . strangely  many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english  and poorly too . whether this is just a very bad case of looping  an effort to minimize accents  or a simple case of nostalgia  it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible  merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films  it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . look  if you have jackie chan playing a chef  why not use that to your advantage ? watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen  beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . the action is a mixed bag here . there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site  apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst  but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . once or twice  it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . but to slo-mo jackie running ? either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man  or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix  go ahead and see mr . nice guy . however  if you're just in the mood for some good action  you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work  such as supercop .

"1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject  or  to be precise  same "" high concept "" . in summer 1994  that "" high concept "" was "" mad bomber action thriller "" . in few weeks  "" thrillride of the summer "" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away  so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland  where gaerity ( tommy lee jones )  ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material  escapes from prison . he comes to boston  where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges )  dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past  when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence  betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror  directed specifically at dove's colleagues  friends and relatives . dove  who is just going to retire and start family  now must confront the mad bomber . while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters  using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes  blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed . badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all . screenplay by john bateer and john rice  barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland  using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . the plot is  of course  full of implausibilities . the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual  no matter how brilliant he is  can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . those questions  same as in the case of speed  could be forgotten while the action goes on  but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters . because of them  movie seems a little bit too long  and boring at times . the most annoying element of the film  however  is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . the film have few bright points  though . some of the action scenes are fine  which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii  judgement night ) . and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove's colleague . but  all in all  blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous  yet hardly unforgettable competitor .

"i'm spoiled . long before i had ever read a single michael crichton novel  i read stanislaw lem  the polish science-fiction writer who has far more to say in one book than crichton has had to say in all of his . the book in question was solaris  a novel about a planet that appears to be a life form unto itself . crichton probably didn't plagarize solaris to write sphere  but it's simply an infinitely inferior book compared to lem's novel . sphere  the movie from said novel  suffers from all the same drawbacks . worse  there has already been a movie made of solaris  by the russian filmmaker andrei tarkovsky  which is haunting and chilling in ways that this film  directed passively by barry levinson as a holding action before wag the dog  cannot even begin to conceive of . the plot : a ways back  a psychologist by the name of norma hoffman ( played by * dustin * hoffman )  put together a government report on what to do if e . t . comes calling . he named several colleagues of his as members of a "" contact team "" -- almost jokingly  it seems  but the government gets the last laugh when the team is activated for a mission to the south pacific . sure enough  down on the ocean floor  there are the remains of a spaceship that crashed there -- almost 300 years ago . ( there is one funny moment straight from the book about the maker of the ship's electronics that i will not spoil here . ) what they find is by turns intriguing and idiotic . a pattern gets set up : we get the hint of something that may be an explanation  and then we're forced to discard it and start from absolute scratch . this is annoying . when we finally do understand what the sam hill is going on  it doesn't make any sense -- and the conclusion the movie tries to draw from it is just plain limp . the effects are decent  but they are no more than a light show to support a movie that really isn't about much of anything . i kept harkening back to the abyss  which generated horrible suspense with nothing more than a broken umbilical cable -- or the exploding rivets of das boot . nothing like that holds the attention here . the actors try . they do not get far . samuel jackson is probably the best of the bunch  since he can pretty much survive anything through a show of attitude . sharon stone  who is a better actor than people realize ( see last dance and casino  and the upcoming the mighty ! )  is totally lost . and dustin hoffman himself does a reprise of the same territory he did with outbreak . no wonder they're content to just drift : the material they're given doesn't afford them a chance to really make their performances matter . so . when do we get a tarkovsky revival ?

""" not far from here there's a fence . on the other side of the fence is freedom . that gorilla will never try to get to it . "" starring anthony hopkins  cuba gooding jr .  donald sutherland  maura tierney . rated r . instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as "" powerful "" or "" touching "" . i have a name for it myself : "" gross "" . this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully  the bully looks at the "" rebel "" threateningly  about to hurt him  and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "" inspired "" by something like that ? this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence . instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport  the authorities stick him in a prison's "" psychotics ward "" . assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . and then there's the inevitable "" heartless meanie "" character  in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor . he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . let's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen  on screen or off . any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . not good old theo . no  he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says "" we need to talk about this right now . "" this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems . director jon turteltaub  who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that  contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe  it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . it aims to "" inspire "" rather than to touch hearts . as yoda would say  inspire it does not . it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story . indeed  somewhere in the beginning of instinct  one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character . this  like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review  is a horrid insult to our intelligence . i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors  and he chews the scenery in this movie  brilliant as ever . oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . i love animals  and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable . tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . ©1999 eugene novikov sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ share what you know . learn what you don't .

"little more than an expensive  flashy  and painfully drawn-out season finale  the x files : fight the future has little chance to draw any new fans to the tv show  if this is the best that can be done . the movie opens with agents mulder ( duchovny ) and scully ( anderson ) finding themselves on a new assignment after the closing of the x-files . of course  through a bizarre coincidence  their very first assignment leads them to uncover a conspiracy involving the hiding of bodies of some would-be aliens . the plot turns alternately confusing and ridiculous after that . it's surprising that a tv show which leaves so much to the imagination does so little for it in feature film version . at two hours  x files is really pretty boring . i found myself falling asleep in the especially dull first half  only to be revived later by one thing after another that * just didn't make any sense ! * for example  if the bad guys went to so much trouble to * blow up a building * in order to hide four bodies  why were the bodies recovered in perfect condition ? why does the road the agents follow on gut instinct alone lead directly to the bad guys ? why did a bee wait 24 hours in scully's coat before stinging her ? why does the syndicate want to destroy the world - and if it has the power ( imminently displayed in the film )  then why don't they just do it ! ? then again  if a vaccine to this destruction exists ( again  displayed in the film )  then why don't the good guys just release * that * into the world ? well  you won't find any answers to questions like these in the film . in fact  the movie goes a long way toward undoing the mysteries that the tv show has built up over the last five years . if this is a portent for the way things are going to go next season  i'm not sure i'm interested . still  i am a fan  and there's enough juice to sustain a fan's interest for awhile . it ain't much  but watching scully and mulder inch closer romantically  and seeing some cool special effects is worth the price of admission .

"directed by : betty thomas written by : susannah grant cast : sandra bullock  domenic west  elizabeth perkins  steve buscemi mpaa : rated pg-13 for mature thematic elements involving substance abuse  language and some sensuality . runtime : usa : 103 "" alcohol and drugs = bad . not alcohol and drugs = good . got it ? "" just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen  be that insanity or alcoholism  hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep  emotional stories about finding yourself' . . '28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings . gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . for her life was a big party  with no beginning and no end . this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west )  borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house . this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab . here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption  willpower and commitment . most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . the film itself feels like a rehab program  whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . it is a classic cautionary tale . an echo . a big  fat and expensive cliché . a shadow of last year's 'girl  interrupted'  which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' . director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors  that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation  despair  terror  confusion  loneliness . and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy  homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke  drink or watch tv after 11 . it is simply too light  simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . "" all you need to do is just say no ""  says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . and that's how simple it is ! in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again  than return to '28 days' . as for acting  it's acceptable  but hardly anything else . for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' . she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations  but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . although intellectually 'girl  interrupted' was a greater achievement  '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect . there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing  but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better . 'clean and sober'  'only when i laugh'  'when a man loves a woman'  'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . so what's the point ? in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre  you might as well go in and watch '28 days' . under all other circumstances stay away  because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost .

"'stepmom' has the worst screenplay i've ever seen for subject matter contained within its genre . contrived  pretentious  corn ball  and shallow are just a few adjectives that would be accurate in describing it . releasing it during the holidays and using two cute kids in marketing it is shameful as this is not a family film . don't misunderstand . it is about family but the bad taste it leaves in the mouth is unacceptable for children . it starts out by telling you that two women who interact with the same man---one the ex wife  and one his current lover  will naturally hate each other at first but will come to accept and even like each other later on . i've known families and have seen it within my own family and circle of friends that once somebody hates another person  it's permanent . julia roberts is a photographer in love with lawyer ed harris ( in a completely wasted role ) . harris' ex-wife ( susan sarandon ) lives alone and the couple have an older daughter and a younger son . the kids hate dad's new main squeeze and despite her attempt to like and please them  they stick it to her every chance they get . every time sarandon and roberts see each other  they are like oil and water . one thinks the other is a b * * * * while the other sees her rival as inexperienced and unable to cope with family . caught in the middle of all of this  naturally  are the children . one of the kids has a laugh that is so irritating that it will make you shriek to the point of wanting to throw stuff at the movie screen . this film is like a rock that has been thrown into a pond . it sinks straight to the bottom . it goes nowhere in a credible fashion in a running time of more than two hours . the performances in 'stepmom' are somewhat admirable but it's too bad the actors didn't have the wisdom to realize that by making the most of a bad script can't make for a good movie . 'stepmom' has the worst poker face i've ever seen . it's obvious and doesn't know how to cover-up its sugar coated shortcomings and therefore it fails . chris columbus ( 'home alone'  'mrs . doubtfire' ) directs this film without a clue as to how you go about the usual input of a director's own idea of how a film is shaped to decide its final outcome . upon reading a script  a director can make a fairly good film from a superficial screenplay and therefore a film can be redeemed at least part of the way . the screenplay by gigi levangie  jessie nelson  steven rogers  karen leigh hopkins and ron bass ( five people ? ) has enough laughably bad dialogue to insult the intelligence of even the most casual movie fan who only sees about five or six movies per year . as studios continue to take away more and more of a director's artistic licence  movie audiences will find less and less to appreciate  especially film buffs . with standards being lowered  box office figures continue to rise  not because audiences are pleased with the results of a final cut and keep coming back but because movie theatres are being built with bigger and better technology to distract us away from the movie and into the theatre's coffee shop  restaurant or arcade which sometimes are more entertaining .

"" parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body  leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block . even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this  they've been saved by an energetic approach . this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability  who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture  it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . on that level  the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that  the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that  they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la "" dawson's creek . "" needless to say the acting is far from top notch  nor does necessity ask that it should be . there is a moment or two of genuine horror  but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . in sum  the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off .

"america's sweethearts ( 2001 ) julia roberts  billy crystal  catherine zeta-jones  john cusack  hank azaria  stanley tucci  christopher walken  seth green . screenplay by billy crystal & peter tolan . directed by joe roth . 100 minutes . rated pg-13  2 stars ( out of five stars ) review by ed johnson-ott  nuvo newsweekly www . nuvo . net archive reviews at http : //reviews . imdb . com/reviewsby ? edward + johnson-ott to receive reviews by e-mail at no charge  send subscription requests to ejohnsonott@prodigy . net or e-mail ejohnsonott-subscribe@onelist . com with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line . "" america's sweethearts "" has an intriguing premise and a great cast  but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal  who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting "" comic relief "" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . crystal ignores a simple  but crucial  rule : for a screwball comedy to work  the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting  because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . "" america's sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket  where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . it's a promising set-up  but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules  thus dissipating the tension of the situation . by the end of the film  all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on  but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison  a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria )  a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together  six crossed the $100 million mark  but the prospects for their final effort  a space opus titled "" time over time  "" are far from rosy . while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup  gwen's solo films have tanked . to make matter worse  the director of the movie ( christopher walken )  a "" visionary "" who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard  is withholding the film from the studio  insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . desperate to win over the press  the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal )  a recently fired publicist  to salvage the situation . lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts )  gwen's sister  personal assistant and whipping girl . what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie  a fact that could temper her effectiveness . press junkets are a haven for control freaks . studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel  with food and drink always at hand . generally  on the evening of their arrival  writers are bussed to see the featured film  then ferreted straight back to the hotel . the next day  writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . every 30 minutes or so  a producer  director  writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions  with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression  writers are free to ask what they want  but understand that if the studio dislikes a question  they may not be invited to future junkets . representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew  with the studio filming the exchanges . the "" reporters "" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars  but to play it safe  the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired  but the screenplay undermines the conceit . the junket is moved from the handsome  but highly confining  four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . for most of the film  the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds  completely safe from the eyes of the press . when they do deal with journalists  the "" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters "" premise is de-clawed . gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll  they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and  at the screening of the movie  everyone connected with the film goes nuts  all without any repercussions . lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact  he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? hell no  they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in "" america's sweethearts "" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters  except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity . and thus the very set-up for the film implodes  leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . so what about the cast ? julia roberts  at her best playing the underdog  is utterly charming here  although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one  by the way ) . catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . by casting himself as the publicist  billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on "" comic relief "" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . in supporting roles  hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed "" too broad . "" seth green is amusing as a toadie  stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair  though he has little to work with . come to think of it  "" little to work with "" is the operative phrase for this movie . as a hollywood satire  "" america's sweethearts "" is toothless . as a romance  it is at best a minor pleasure . such a good cast  such a waste of their efforts . had it not been taken long ago  a better title for the film would have been "" much ado about nothing .

"shining in such classics as willy wonka and the chocolate factory and young frankenstein  gene wilder is easily a big pull for renting a comedy movie . there's just something different ( and funny ) about his voice  his face  and his physical humor . that's how start the revolution without me grabbed me off the comedy shelf  and i'm here to help you through not letting that happen to you . philippe ( wilder ) and pierre ( sutherland ) are rich french gentlemen . they have to make some type of agreement on a treaty and are traveling to france to do just that . when they dock  they do battle with a group of homeless pirates ( or something of the sort ) that claude ( wilder again ) and charles ( sutherland again ) are a part of . claude and philippe were separated at birth  the same with pierre and charles . so  naturally  the two get mixed up and are mistaken for the other two . when claude is taken to the king's palace and asked by the king's servant the kill the queen  the two have to escape and are sent into a madcap run around the house ( ? ) avoiding a maniac  a nymphomaniac  ( ? ) and the rest of the king's servants . they somehow start a war with the homeless pirates again that philippe and pierre are now ( unwillingly ) a part of  and they go to battle . i think that i laughed exactly twice in start the revolution without me . the film obviously has some problems  the main one being that wilder ( and the script ) go way over-the-top with the stupid quota on this one . it takes the fact that the twins are mixed up as the film's 100 minute joke . it also doesn't really help seeing what donald sutherland looked like when he was younger either . ( i actually do feel very sorry for him . ) but the worst thing is that the film breaks an alltime rule . any film with orson welles is either good or funny . horribly broken here as he appears for commentry before the film and as part of the film's extremely strange ending . ( that amazingly ends like some film with hair gel and a dog . ) this is a member of the film's that you could see if you enjoy inflicting pain on yourself club ( ftycsiyeipoyc is what i call it  and i do review so many of them . ) so start the revolution without me gets * star . the young-uns : the film contains some sexual references and the end has lots of gun battle . also  some young children may be confused by what is going on . good age : 7 & up

"i'm going to keep this one fairly short  folks . in fact  i'm not even going to attempt a plot summary because there isn't any plot in "" black and white "" . james toback  previously responsible for releasing the atrocious "" two girls and a guy "" on unsuspecting audiences back in 1997  has created a true piece of garbage here . this is the kind of movie that screams for an nc-17 rating  being filled with fairly explicit sex scenes  constant violence  and more foul language than you hear in any quentin tarantino film . the mpaa rating system is supposed to keep kids from seeing a movie like this  but the theater i saw it in was filled with young high school students . i know it's naive to think that kids won't see a movie like this no matter what kind of rating it has  yet i can't help but think an nc-17 rating would have prevented at least a few kids from attending . first i'll try to cover what i liked about this movie  which shouldn't take too long . there are one or two slightly comical moments  though i can't seem to remember what they involved . that about sums up what i liked about this movie . i don't often award one or five star ratings  but i was very tempted to give only one to this piece of filth . i knew i was in trouble as soon as the film started with a semi-pornographic scene involving two of the main characters ( bijou phillips  power ) and one minor character in a threesome in the middle of the woods . i suppose the purpose of this scene was to convey how messed up these kids are  but it struck me as being present only for shock value . in fact  there are several sex scenes sprinkled throughout "" black and white "" which enhance the so-called story in no way . i will hand one thing to toback  he pulled in quite a cast . ben stiller  robert downey jr .  brooke shields  claudia schiffer  and the great joe pantoliano all make appearances in this god forsaken movie . stiller ( "" there's something about mary "" ) plays a gambler ( a somewhat autobiographical decision by toback i think ) who appears very few times and never quite fits in with the rest of the movie . robert downey jr . ( the horrendous "" two girls and a guy "" ) plays a gay man  who i believe was intended to be humorous but was simply vulgar instead . brooke shields ( "" the blue lagoon "" ) and claudia schiffer both show up in very minor roles  which distract the audience rather than add anything to the movie . last  but certainly not least  is joe pantoliano ( "" the matrix ""  "" bound "" )  who is completely wasted as a father of two of the young  stupid characters . showing up in a hilariously pointless cameo is mike tyson himself . allow me to now point out the half dozen or so items which make this a horrendous movie . one  half the dialogue is completely unintelligble . the characters banter back and forth  swearing every other word and saying things which no one over the age of fifteen could possibly understand . two  there is no plot to speak of . there are a few subplots involving things like sports gambling and coping with ones identity  but none of these side stories are ever developed . three  i think this was supposed to be a profound look at racism and life in an inner city  but it succeeds only at insulting members of both races . fourth  there is no direction whatsoever . the movie jumps aimlessly from person to person and situation to situation without any idea where it is going . lastly  the film's ending left me with a sick feeling in my stomach . i normally don't give away plot points  but the movie's ending seems to imply that family can triumph over anything by doing things like pulling together to lie and cover up murders . "" black and white "" runs the longest 98 minutes you'll ever experience . i recommend it to absolutely no one and give it one and a half out of five stars .

"you know you're in big trouble when halfway through a movie you ask yourself  "" what would be better ? sitting through the rest of this garbage or receiving a scratch to the retina ? "" ultimately  the question is moot  since both are examples of ocular mayhem . the impulse as you sit through dungeons & dragons is to close your eyes  thereby shielding yourself from those atrocious computer-generated zooming up and down gaudily-colored castles and cloud-capped palaces . unfortunately  the sound design is so brutal with those sharp rings as swords clash  glitter dust swirls  and magic spells go whoosh that sleep is not a viable option . consider just this small aspect of the film : why is it that the main characters are dressed like tolkein's rangers but sound like the real world  some gaudy hybrid of conan the barbarian and star wars : episode i ? indeed  it's nearly impossible to look at the young empress savina ( thora birch  american beauty ) without thinking about natalie portman's headdress . say what you will about the george lucas film  portman did manage to appear regal . birch  on the other hand  comes off as a bubble-headed valley girl whose glib talk of equality for everyone would fit comfortably on the stage of a high school beauty contest . in our opening tracking shot across the sea  while dragons fly underfoot  we hear a ponderous voice-over throwing out strange names and places . we haven't been introduced to anyone yet  and i defy the viewer to make sense of it . what we do get is this : the mages are attempting to overthrow the empire of izmer  while the commoners struggle for equal rights . profion ( former academy award winner jeremy irons ) seeks the scepter to control the power of the golden dragons  but we also learn of an equally powerful rod which unites the red dragons . are you with me so far ? there's a quiz afterwards . it's around this time that we meet the two young thieves  ridley ( justin whalin ) and his silly black sidekick  step 'n' fetchit ( marlon wayans  requiem for a dream ) . actually  the wayans character is called snails  who will sacrifice anything  even his life if need be  to save massah . spike lee would have a field day with wayans' bug-eyed performance . of course  wayans is bringing it on himself -- he's clearly set up as the white man's burden and is handled as such . his final scene nails the coffin shut on my case . ridley and snails sneak into the inner sanctum of a wizard who has some sort of secret scroll ( another prop ) that the bad guys are after . as the good guys set off on their adventure  they team up with a young magician ( zoe mclellan ) who never actually uses her magic -- she's too busy waiting for the boys to rescue her . since jeremy irons only wants to pick up his paycheck for this film  he sends the sinister damodar ( bruce payne ) in hot pursuit . together  the thieves  the young magician  and a few other trusty sidekicks run through a series of hoops  with the crazy kids wandering through forests and towns  thieves' mazes  and enemy castles . to keep things entertaining  they never let up on their sarcastic repartee  slapping each other high-fives . meanwhile  snails ponders the immortal question  "" massah  why do you always get to save the girl while i go after the dwarf ? "" riddle me that  batman ! the sorry excuse for a plot builds up to an elaborate  if incomprehensible  dragon war . buildings are smashed  swords are drawn  and the sky runs red with blood ( actually  computer generated clouds that might have been swell in tomb raider but won't be fooling anyone here ) . jeremy irons gets to stand at the top of a tower cackling  contorting his face  and  ultimately  destroying his career with such aplomb that i wonder when he'll work in this town again . is there anything good which can be said about dungeons & dragons ? fans of the role-playing game will be distressed as they see their beloved world contorted into a travesty . those who loved the saturday morning cartoon will wonder why the filmmakers didn't simply use that cute  kid-friendly story as source material . everyone else out there is on their own . just pretend this review is a large iron gate where  written large  are the words abandon hope  all ye who enter here . postscript : there is one good thing i can say about the film  which perhaps will be of little interest to anyone who never saw the wonderful british sci-fi show  doctor who . my boyhood hero  tom baker  who played the good doctor throughout the '70s  makes a cameo appearance in d&d as the lord of the elves . it made me feel good to know that he is still getting work .

"( warner brothers ) running time : 134 minutes ( 2 hours 14 minutes ) starring dustin hoffman  sharon stone  samuel l . jackson directed by barry levinson with his successful books and movies  michael crichton is doing well . with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 )  and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 )  his films have been entertaining . however  he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull  long winded  and a huge disappointment . considering the huge budget  the all star cast  and a story by crichton  sphere is majorly disappointing . the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman )  a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors . however  when he arrives  he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft . along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson )  biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . ) they investigate the spaceship  find a massive sphere inside  meet an alien intelligence called jerry  and basically weird crap happens . unfortunately  something went wrong along the way with sphere . the film starts off entertaining enough  but throughout this very long movie  it just gets sillier and sillier . the film jaunts along from scene to scene  never fully explaining what is going on . the actors and directing don't help  either . hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie  churning out dull lines  and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie . stone is useless  displaying no emotion  and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman . the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson  who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere . but he's hardly in it  and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . the same goes for peter coyote  who hams it up as the officer  but is then killed off halfway through . the director  barry levinson  who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action . the drama scenes are  quite frankly  boring  and the action scenes suffer from overkill  with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2  1997 ) the writing doesn't help much  either . although crichton is great with plots  he's terrible with dialogue  and practically every line in sphere is a dud . the speech is too simple  i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . practically every line is just stating the obvious . none of it is smart . also  where the hell did the budget go ? the sphere itself is impressive  and there's a few nice special effect shots  but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess . there's a giant squid attack in the picture  but not once does the audience see the squid  even though the film has a massive budget . i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid  and if handled correctly it probably would . but the whole scene is done badly  and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . finally  the film has no idea what genre to be . levison can't handle his own plot . it leaps from hokey sci-fi  to horror  and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller . and  of course  the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 )  although in it's defense  crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) it's not all that bad though . the plot is all right  there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit . but overall  sphere is a big waste of some fine talent  a lot of money  and a potentially good movie . not really worth seeing . overall rating= review by david wilcock

"millennium starts with an incredibly fake model of a boeing 747 skipping the tops of clouds  bumping all over the place . we go to the cockpit  where the crew is drawling atc clearances  and the captain  for some reason  so senile that he's taking orders from his first officer . inexplicably  the airplane has a mid-air with a dc-10 . on the way down  the flight engineer's sent to the back . he returns as promptly  shouting "" the passengers are all dead !

"my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled "" dragnet "" reruns off the air . sure  i'd seen them all at least once  but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment  we webb anti-fans still have the d . i .  a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet . "" for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness  think of the d . i . as what would happen if sgt . joe friday ever enlisted  because he plays exactly the same character here  a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded  melodramatic speeches on any topic . in this election year  i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters . he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying . this is his movie all the way  and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason  i was wondering if there would even be a plot . i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants  but the d . i . gives us more -- much more . webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens  the local screw-up . the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or  the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . "" ( whether the "" lace panties "" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) this  of course  gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell . for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching  here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his . i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper  but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . . "" now you listen to me  youngster . someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness . . . i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours  you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there . "" i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame )  but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines  like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . he meets a woman who  coincidentally  also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival  another marine d . i . webb marches over to the table  gets up in her face and says  "" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "" bogart he ain't . the other d . i . gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl  "" he's a damn good d . i . . . . i guess i'm just a little jealous . "" join the club  we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women  which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene  as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment  a lingerie store  and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . "" you expect me to talk to you . . . in _here_ ? ! "" he exclaims  no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . the woman goes off to help a customer  leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . a little girl spots him in the store and demands  "" what are you doing in here . . . you're a man  aren't you ? "" he doesn't reply  but you know he's thinking in his head  "" what an odd species of human -- so small . must be one of those children everyone's been talking about . "" this poor girl  scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb  would later swear off the male gender entirely  just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for . the movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance  it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie  where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea  webb asks owens  "" was that flea you killed a male or female ? "" owens replies  "" a male  sir . "" webb yells to the platoon  "" this ain't the one ! "" that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i .  but for iwo jima  guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . someone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did . it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . there's a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . webb bursts in the room and shouts  "" what did i tell you about laughing ? ! "" to which the private replies  "" sir  only nine-year-old girls laugh  sir ! "" and let me tell you  i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie .

"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades  like twelve angry men  serpico or the verdict . but  in the same time  almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . a stranger among us  1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness  belongs to the latter category . the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith )  tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . during one of such actions  her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result  she becomes depressed . in order to help her recover  bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community  she decides to go undercover . that isn't easy  because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . but the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . the author of this review never liked this actress very much  but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . role of emily eden  unfortunately  isn't one of them . first of all  she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter  and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . but  on the other hand  other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi  thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride )  and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . also  the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .

"that's exactly how long the movie felt to me . there weren't even nine laughs in nine months . it's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man  mr . hugh grant  a huge dork . it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant  not me ) that bugs me  it's the fact that grant is annoying . not just adam sandler-annoying  we're talking jim carrey-annoying . since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? but  on the other hand  since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams  the obstetrician  tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has "" a big pussy  "" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat  but nonetheless  grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . why a child psychologist ? so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange :

"i admit it . i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . watching him in jingle all the way  i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop  but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence  alcohol consumption  burglary  racism and child molestation . and you know they'll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa's elves . he later decks a reindeer . hey  man  why don't you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you're at it ? jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass  it must be funny school of thought . arnold  sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team  and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can't find a rare toy on christmas eve  and will do anything to get one ? arnold is  of course  one of the parents  a crack salesman who is never there for his son . he races from the office to his son's karate game  only to find out he missed it . and his kid distrusts him because he's never around . ( gee  we haven't seen that in a movie before . ) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son's affection is to get him a turboman doll  which his wife ( rita wilson  who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . so arnold sets out to find a turboman  which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . let me back up for a minute here -- arnold's kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character  which is unhealthy beyond belief . watches the show  eats the cereal  sleeps on the freakin' turboman sheets . i'd try to discourage any further obsession myself  lest any kid seeing this movie think it's a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . but nooooo  the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade  exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son  who don't recognize him until the last minute . this is a sad movie all the way through  but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store  racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station  where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets )  but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( "" your cookies are incredible "" )  it's the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it's okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . maybe that's what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house  but not at mine . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1  000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

"cast - ben affleck  gary sinise  charlize theron  dennis farina  james frain  donal logue  danny trejo  clarence williams iii  issac hayes . directed by - john frankenheimer written by - ehren kruger produced by - marty katz  chris moore  bob weinstein ( rating )  motion picture association of america - r ( restricted )  rated r for strong violence  language and sexuality . running length - 105 minutes distributor - dimension films if this person were alive today  the inventor of the gun might be troubled by the lack of use of them at the proper time in 'reindeer games' . while there really are no good guys in this film  how many times have we seen the hollywood cliche of the villains holding someone at gun point while the audience is frustrated that the silly and simple action of pulling the trigger doesn't come at the right time . even when we don't want to see someone get shot in the picture because he or she is the hero  it still smacks of a lack of credibility . the only time i found this acceptable was in the old 'batman' t . v . series  where the villains wouldn't or couldn't shoot straight and the dynamic duo was always put into some kind of campy trap from which they always managed to escaped . to roughly quote 1976's 'network'  "" no matter how much trouble the hero is in  just look at your watch and you'll know when all will be resolved "" . by rights  ben affleck should have died about five times throughout the course of 'reindeer games' and while i'm not giving away the fact as to whether he lives or dies in the film  the keyword for this film is "" duh "" ! affleck plays rudy  a convict on the verge of release where  when released  he will meet with a young woman who will help him get his life back on track  supposedly . he's never met her and she's never met him . they met through letters written . but wait ! this is only a smoke screen . rudy passes himself off as his cell mate  a man who was killed in a prison riot who was supposed to meet this woman . while finding the company of women irresistible after getting released  rudy gets more than he bargained for when his new main squeeze ashley ( charlize theron )  has a supposed brother named gabriel ( gary sinise ) who wants rudy to help him knock over a casino . it seems that rudy's cell mate wrote ashley that he used to work at this casino  run on a native american reservation in michigan  near detroit  and gabriel  thinking this is him  wants instructions on the casino's construction  pattern of security and other tidbits of information that will make the casino heist successful . of course  rudy can only bluff his way through the scam since he isn't the right or real person intended for this crime . the film is so full of plot holes  you could drive a transport truck through its openings and believe me  they try this also ! at one point rudy tries to explain that he isn't the right man and a hand written letter is produced by gabriel so to establish if this is really the right guy  why didn't they just take a sample of rudy's hand writing to see if it's the same guy . rudy also has several chances to contact the police but we see that admitting to the police that he is being held by criminals would be a violation of his parole  therefore landing him back in the slammer . even if this is beyond his control ? several confrontations between the characters are also laughable and the film is full of smug humour and novice plot twists that don't seem exciting  plausible or even remotely entertaining and something is also wrong when the leading man can't get any support from the audience . director john frankenheimer ( 'the manchurian candidate'  'birdman of alcatraz' 'grand prix'  'black sunday' and more recently 'ronin'  directs this film with his usual look of perplexity . the trouble is  that while crafting his vision for this film  he overlooked the flaws in the screenplay by ehren kruger who wrote 1999's 'arlington road'  a crackling thriller about terrorism and 'reindeer games' doesn't even look like it's written by the same guy . perhaps the desire to be completely different threw kruger off course and he faltered badly with this film . several other mishaps that make the film somewhat aloof involve rudy trying to make an escape from the casino and getting caught in the wilderness . we see that he has a knack for hot wiring cars . there are plenty around in this scene . why not just hi-jack one and make a run for it . oh  the irony of it . geeeeeesh ! characters played by dennis farina  james frain  donal logue  danny trejo  clarence williams iii  and issac hayes are given no real focus and some of them have major time on screen and this is only an added and unwanted annoyance . john frankenheimer has tried his hand at hack second rate pictures before such as '52 pick-up'  'the holcroft covenant' and 'year of the gun' and had little or no success with them . he is a director capable of so much more but falls into the rut of making movies like 'reindeer games' and for a man whose been in the business for 50 years  you'd think he'd know better . it isn't evident here . perhaps a better name for this film would have been 'silly games' .

" directed by greg arraki starring james duval  rachel true  kathleen robertson  ryan phillippe  sarah lassez  christina applegate gregg araki's the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made . so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ? first of all  some of the reviews were fairly positive . also  the cast  consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight  eve plumb  shannen doherty  and david leisure ) was promising . last of all  i wanted to give arraki one more chance . i mean  the guy can't be that untalented  can he ? the answer to that question is three letters long . nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles . since arraki doesn't know how to make anything coherent  it's hard to describe the plot . let's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls . the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star . he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans . this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming . it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki  and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez . i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft . he works better with the camera this time around  especially in the early scenes . halfway through the film  i didn't necessarily find myself enjoying the film  but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation . then as the movie went on  arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads  twisted sex games  and alien abductions . it's sad  because he almost actually had some decent material here  but he ruined it with his usual in your face "" i'm such a renegade maverick filmmaker  look what i can do "" attitude . the performances are generally better than in the doom generation  which isn't saying much . at least we don't have to suffer jonathan "" i am the most hideous man in america "" schaech . we are  however treated to another round of james "" i'm more wooden than keanu "" duval . sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film  and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arraki's wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess . of the tv star cameos  john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist . if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation  it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture . maybe greg arraki doesn't want you to like his characters . maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them . maybe he just wanted to piss me off . if so  he was successful .

"the happy bastard's quick movie reviewthe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid  really . shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . sadly  that is the case with kingpin  a film directed by the farrelly brothers  the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . since the duo directed and didn't write the script  i can assume that's part of the problem . the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . his popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground . then  however  he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray )  a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for  well  anything . these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting  and  before roy sees it coming  ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . forward seventeen years later  where roy has become quite the loser  complete with mechanical hand  torn-up car  and  of course  the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . however  he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley  where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid )  who has quite the bowling arm . with the kid's help  he figures he can be known again  particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno  nevada . of course  the amish kid needs some coaxing  particularly when you consider  well  he's amish . this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film  such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . finally  the duo get on the road and  along the way  pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . the main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny . in fact  it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it  such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . but that's just it- scenes . there's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie  like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . i mean  was this really necessary ? couldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? i mean  this is a comedy  why throw ethics in ? particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle  where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? that really ruined it  however  and that's too bad . the acting is top notch  especially from angel and murray  and the really funny scenes are worth noting . still  if you're going to think dumb  think dumb all the way through  ok ? at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked .

"lancelot du lac ( lancelot du lac ) ( france  1974 ) a film review by james kendrick director : robert bresson screenwriter : robert bresson ( based on the epic poem by chretien de troyes ) stars : luc simon ( lancelot )  laura duke condominas ( queen guinevere )  vladimir antolek-oresek ( king arthur )  humbert balsan ( gawain )  patrick bernhard ( modred )  arthur de montalembert ( lionel ) mpaa rating : not rate review : ench director robert bresson's "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's "" morte darthur . "" instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table  it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak  ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous  bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . chivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake  "" except as that of a dying ideal . bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning  decimated  after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail  the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood . bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . the opening sequence is a series of clumsy  disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off  a stomach is impaled  a skull is split open  skeletal remains hang from trees  and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin  and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion  it doesn't carry the grand  tragic resonance of other arthurian films . we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power  therefore there is no real downfall to witness . but  then again  it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . rather  it is lancelot  and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart  than the external downfall of a kingdom . lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales  and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . the greatest of all knights  he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife  queen guinevere  and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas )  he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom  but he is powerless in his passion . when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair  other knights  including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense . it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit  and the consequences are dire . bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds . "" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down  minimalist style  flat  expressionless dialogue  and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . he uses background music only twice in the film  during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes  but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor  the neighing of horses  the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads  and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . like most of his other films  bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless  flat voices . all the actors he used in "" lancelot of the lake "" had never acted before  and with the exception of patrick bernhard  they never acted again . never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . instead of using vocal inflection  bresson strove to create emotion through images . in some ways  this technique works ; in other ways  it doesn't . the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous  and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . however  other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . for instance  during an important jousting contest  bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs . he does this repeatedly  opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . while there might be symbolic value in this  the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . nevertheless  "" lancelot of the lake "" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . bresson's style may not be for everyone  but one has to respect his strength as an artist . by re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own  he turns "" lancelot of the lake "" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film .

"director : brian de palma writer : david koepp ( based on the novels "" carlito's way "" and "" after hours "" by edwin torres ) starring : al pacino  sean penn  penelope ann miller  john leguiziamo  luis guzman  john rebhorn  viggio mortensen  jorge porcel what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is . having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film  "" scent of a woman  "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar )  "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven . that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it  and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . "" carlito's way "" deals with  well  carlito brigante ( pacino )  a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin  who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted  curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . of course  carlito was actually awoken in prison  and has decided to go straight  even if he's really a crook at heart . carlito  like barry lyndon  is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn  and can't escape into something he is not . carlito's attempts at a clean  legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . when he first gets out  a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out  where he has to kill a couple people to survive . he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal  and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit  needing him to try and help him out  which includes him doing some prison breaking . carlito  like ratso rizzo  wants to go to miami ( since  according to film logic  that's where it's at )  but needs some funding . being a legend  he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s  by the way  and since some of this takes place in night clubs  we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics  including several k . c . and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman  at his best )  and is soon running a pretty good business  even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs  like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo )  who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . on the other side  the symbol of promise and hope  is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? )  his girlfriend from before prison . she's a goregeous ballerina  and a stripper  and soon carlito is trying to get back with her  and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . while this relationship is never fully defined or anything  we get a sense of love between them  and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . all of these elements clash together at the end  in a brilliantly executed  emotional climax  which is inevitable . when i say inevitable  i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack  putting a great spin on it . sure  it's going to eleveate some of the tension  but it gives the film a lot of depth  as carlito is seen trapped by fate . what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . like "" apollo 13  "" we know what's going to happen  but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle . it's also very emotional  thanks to a great script by david koepp  and amazing performances by pacino and miller . de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . his earlier flim  "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead )  has a ton of it  especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over ) . but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . to me  the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building  looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . this is the most brilliantly done  and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film  and probably the best in de palma film history . with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background  and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head  and a saddened  remorseful look on pacino's face  it's a tear-jerker ( well  for me  i dunno about you . . . ) . the acting from all is great  especially from the three leads . pacino was panned for his performance  chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and  well  it wasn't as "" strong "" as his oscar-winning role in "" scent of a woman . "" well  his "" scent of a woman "" performance was great and all  but it was nothing really but  as comic kevin pollack said  a "" foghorn leghorn impression . "" in "" carlito's way  "" he's emotional  and strong  despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle  which he cannot change . i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing  insult-throwing blind guy in "" scent of a woman . "" as i said  penelope ann miller is great  and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . and they're scenes are well-written  with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . and sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . every scene he's in  he has great energy  and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . in smaller roles  john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . "" carlito's way "" is one of those films which you heard about briefly  but when you finally watch it  you're absolutely blown away . it's a wonderful film  a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn't do so hot . but trust me and check it out . it's a great little film  and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right .

"six days  seven nights reviewed by jamie peckrating :  touchstone / 1 : 41 / 1998 / pg-13 ( language  innuendo  violence ) cast : harrison ford ; anne heche ; david schwimmer ; jacqueline obradors ; temuera morrison ; allison janney ; douglas weston ; cliff curtis ; danny trejo director : ivan reitman screenplay : michael browning  "" six days  seven nights "" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right  a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff  recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . of course  the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . as his female counterpart  anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet  goofily charismatic performance . the age difference ( ford's 56  heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by . the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris  while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . robin  on a tropical vacation with fiancé frank ( david schwimmer )  gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti  so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . the plane crashes during a terrible storm  and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . a series of unpleasant  often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . meanwhile  back at the resort  frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing  and while it makes for a few good laughs early on  it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways  this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . at a slim 101 minutes  "" six days  seven nights "" never wears out its welcome  where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . michael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite  taken in context  is "" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? "" )  and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another  they're all quite engaging . even the movie's more "" serious "" moments are played with a wink . heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the "" believability "" of "" six days  seven nights "" ' heterosexual pairing . ( so she's a lesbian . so what . deal with it . ) of course it doesn't  and here  her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . in fact  her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost  endearing electricity . at one point  when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest  heche asks ford how old he is . after several wrong guesses ( "" forty-five ? _fifty_ ? "" )  he whispers his age to her . "" you still look good  "" heche stammers . "" i still _am_ good  "" ford replies . she's good too  and together  they make "" six days  seven nights "" one memorable ride . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the new and improved reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ "" suggestions  please  for the fourth movie in the series . how about 'look who's talking back  ' in which the audience gets its turn ?

"cast : mel gibson ( jerry fletcher )  julia roberts ( alice sutton )  patrick stewart ( dr . jonas )  cylk cozart ( agent lowry ) director : richard donner certification : r ( usa ) presumably for violence  language  and intense situations year of production : 1997 i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . this was  of course  a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . not only did i get to see an advance screening  i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher  a fast-talking  witty  comical taxi driver in new york city . gibson's performance is terrific  and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . gibson again teams up with richard donner  as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick  and this time around  the combination works even better . the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who  this time around  is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . if you can imagine that  then you've basically got jerry fletcher . in many ways  i was surprised by this movie . to begin with  i was surprised at how good it was . don't get me wrong  it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring  but it was a very enjoyable movie . secondly  i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . he provided a fantastic performance . the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick  which after viewing  it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners  hilarious situations  and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . for instance  jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . and last  i was surprised at how good the plot is . writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story  and when watching this film  you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton  the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher  who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . he also seems obsessed and in love with her . but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories  she shrugs him and his beliefs off  continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . jerry  obviously determined to continually seek out the truth  continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory  which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . although he only has five subscribers  he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work  and publishes his next edition . very soon after he does so  he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . after barely escaping alive  jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense  with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . and more along the way  the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . many things are explained throughout this film  both to the characters and to the audience . for instance  the meaning of the book "" the catcher in the rye "" and its ties to assassins  the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . lee harvey oswald and james earl ray )  and the real truth behind the grateful dead . make sure listen closely throughout the film  as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . definitely  when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th  make sure you are standing in line to see it . i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film  especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . and even if you aren't  you should still like this film .  * david landers - dml@gwis . com - http : //www . gwis . com/~dml/ *

"all great things come to an end  and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly . beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling  the company kozmo . com  an online convenience store stocked with ice cream  porn videos  and other basic necessities of a urban dweller  all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour . designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks  a 27 year old goldman sachs banker  and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years  raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon . com . by december 1999  the company boasted 4  000 employees in 11 cities  its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention . the company was set for an ipo in may 2000 . . . until april 14  2000  the day the stock market took its first big dive  ending the internet era . by april 13  2001  kozmo was out of money and ceased operations . unlike the earlier  similar documentary startup . com  which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot-com  govworks  e-dreams focuses both on its original founders  especially park  and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations . the contrast is amazing  showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing . the film's director  wonsuk chin ( too tired to die )  expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the bike messengers  general managers  and floor staff that kept kozmo humming . the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding  to a degree  the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic-type businesses . in the film's final interviews with park  we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls . in the end  the name of the game was profit  and if you couldn't make money  even the dreamers got the axe . screened at the 24th annual mill valley film festival .

( perhaps the biggest kick i got out of a film with such a sweet religious bent was that it was playing two doors down from the exorcist . ) the director also works in an editorial of his own  commenting on the politics of such a place  where a person of free will may join for the love of god  but is given commands by a higher ranking human . visually  there is a strong connection through disney's lens between the cell of a monastery and a prison cell . but for all the heavy commentary  it's surprising how light and easy blessed art thou feels . depending upon your point-of-view  that could be a strength or a weakness  but at a minimum  i expected a bit more punch at the finish . the film doesn't necessarily demand your 90 minutes in a theater  but  for a thoughtful  eyebrow-raising story  it works . you may now return to associating the disney name with plush toys .

"i seem to be in a minority of one  but chris tucker's outrageous mannerisms are beginning to grow on me . when he appeared in the fifth element as an over-the-top radio dj  my senses misfired : my brain wasn't properly able to compute what i was seeing until i relaxed and had a good time . the same thing applies to rush hour  a sprightly cop-buddy movie that works by being cheerful and engaging instead of cruel and mean-spirited . don't expect it to be an immortal piece of cinema  and you'll be fine . it is also the best of the jackie chan vehicles to be produced in english so far -- it outstrips mr . nice guy by a fair margin  since that movie was little more than a weak clothesline for various action pieces . rush hour is funner and more sustained  and puts chan up against someone who is a terrific foil . the plot is standard-issue . a chinese diplomat's daughter is kidnapped by a gang of criminals . the diplomat wants to enlist the help of lee  an old cop friend of his from pre-1998 hong kong days . the fbi refuses to allow this  so they have the lapd send over one of their own to "" distract "" him . carter ( tucker ) catches on fast to the sleazy runaround he's been given  and tells lee off : he doesn't want to babysit a cop ; he wants to go out there and find these slimeballs . funny thing is  lee feels the same way  and before you know it  they're up to their elbows in suspects and explosives . all of this is  of course  sustained and interleaved with tucker's wild-man motormouthing ( which gets funnier and funnier the more you watch it ) and jackie's typically remarkable stuntwork . what makes all of this stand out is primarily the tone and attitude . most movies in this genre tend to be cold-blooded and unpleasant ; this one's very much a romp  with good timing and pacing  and a lot of good laughs . i'm betting jackie himself is the main reason for that  since he's professed repeatedly that he wants to make more family-oriented movies rather than john woo-style blast-fests . barely anyone gets shot  and most of the martial-arts stunts are about timing  object juggling  or three stooges-style slapstick . ( there is one stunt involving an antique vase that's vintage jackie -- although the way the stunt climaxes is a bit of a cheat . ) there is also the byplay between chan and tucker  much of which seems improvised ( or at least minimally scripted ) . at one point during a stakeout  edwin starr's "" war "" comes on the radio  and jackie attempts to sing along -- only to have tucker coach him on how to sing with soul . in turn  jackie teaches tucker how to do the snatch-the-other-guy's-gun trick ( and the payoff for that gag is a howl ) . my main criterion for a comedy is simple : did i laugh ? i walked into rush hour in a terrible mood  and laughed all the way through . i don't think you can reasonably expect much more than that .

"starring antonio banderas and sir anthony hopkins . directed by martin campbell . running time : 2 hours 15 minutes swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action  funny comedy  and the pacing of a rollercoaster . hopkins plays don diego de la vega  otherwise known as zorro . a fighter for the people  he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson )  who also  unintentionally  kills his wife . the film cuts to twenty years later  where vega still wants to montero dead . however  he's far too old now  and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . banderas motive ? to avenge the death of his brother  who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar  in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . with the scene set  the movie goes on full blast  with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's  playing each other off with ease . hopkins seems to come off a little better  but banderas does some excellent work . as the bad guys  wilson and letscher seem one dimensional  but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . the audience does hate them  which can't be bad . catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter  and although she provides little more than the usual female lead  she delivers a charming  but one note  performance . the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight  and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed  until jones clothes fall off all together . the director  fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . the action is well done and fast paced  the comedy put across well . the cast help a lot  but the direction is still outstanding . although the film is very long  the plot keeps chugging along  and there's barely a dull moment . however  the film is a little over indulgent  and it could have been trimmed . it manages to hold the attention  thankfully  and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . screenwriters john eskow  ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action  the plot itself is barely existent . there's lots of little sub plots hanging around  but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together . the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off . this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . however  this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film  so the film is never quite sure where it's going . in the end however  zorro provides action and comedy in spades . it suitable for everyone  so put the guilt behind  and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . you won't regret it .

"in _daylight_  sylvester stallone breaks no new ground  cinematically speaking  but he covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday  as i was going about my business in the university bookstore  i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . i had never heard of the movie  so i stopped by to check it out . it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . so  i shrugged  thought  "" hey  they probably won't give me the card anyway  and i could always use a free movie  "" so i signed up . all in all  i don't think i got that bad of a deal  either . rob cohen  who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and  more recently  _dragonheart_ ( gee  i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? you think ? )  now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture  with fx by industrial light and magic  about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . sylvester stallone plays kit latura  who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . when the crisis hits  he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_  too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain  where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature . in fact  had the two movies been made in hong kong  this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors . the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup . subplots are woven  and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young  frustrated  jilted  rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . and then  thirty minutes into the film  _boom_ . and it's a big one . from there on in  it's sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does  enduring batterings  beatings  falls  repeated immersion in 34-degree water  explosions  mud  rats  and constant setbacks  before going on to save the day  sly-style . again . . . there's nothing new here . and yet there doesn't need to be . the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution . the special-effects are first-rate  thanks to industrial light and magic  and the ensemble cast works well together . once the film hits its stride  it carries the viewer right along to the finish  with very few jars along the way . this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e . meadows . permission granted for distribution through rec . arts . movies . reviews and all associated archival . permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached . all other rights reserved to the author . -- chris meadows aka | author  team m . e . c . h . a .  crapshoot & co . robotech@jurai . net | with a world wide web homepage located at robotech@eyrie . org | http : //www . jurai . net/~robotech/index . html

"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii  life in a japanese prison camp . to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste . rating : 9 ( 0 to 10 )  + 3 ( -4 to + 4 ) more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . during world war ii  of course  the one goal was winning the war . this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . when the japanese had captured prisoners  they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . while the germans  not known for their kindness in those days  had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war  the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story  perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai . there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . "" lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . it turns out to be a grim joke  one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . beating and torture are commonplace events . men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . however  unlike as in kwai  the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital  called by the prisoners the death house . so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . the japanese believe that the individual is nothing  that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning . conformity is purpose . before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . if the british ( with one american  by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . it is neither . it is a stirring and believable account of camp life . the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . this serves a double purpose for cunningham . it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . it also creates a distancing effect . the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 3 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

"starring : anthony hopkins  alec baldwin  harold perrineau  elle macphersoni swear i have seen the edge before . in fact  it reminded me of the bear  the river wild  and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . however  the edge has done something that most action films should do  and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . in doing so  the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than  say  the peacemaker . unfortunately  because of those overused moments  we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . one surprise  in particular  left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood  and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us  they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . even horror films have learned this  a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . the intelligence of the screenplay  and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . the edge has the intelligence and smart characters  but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . i must admit that it was very suspenseful  and had an original third half  but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . this is an example of the final act saving the film  instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity  it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . but taking scream's lead  the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches  and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character  a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . for once  we don't immediately care for the main character . instead  we like bob ( alec baldwin )  a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife  mickey ( elle macpherson )  out in the wilderness . they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . charles' birthday is the same day  and he receives a gold watch from his wife  and a pocket knife from bob . as action films go  these items do have importance to the rest of the story  but quite a bit more than we first expect . soon  however  bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality . "" charles  bob  bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau )  and the pilot head off to find him  and as shown in the previews  hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . down the plane goes  the pilot is killed  and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow  and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . take  for instance  the entire man-hunting bear plot . this has been done many times in films with different animals  and even bears . but given the charles' intelligence  and bob's uncertainty  many of the cliches are given fresh twists . even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . my favorite line of the film comes from charles : "" most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life . . . thinking . "" despite the predictability of the main plot  a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise  and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore . i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise  so instead i will avoid it entirely . the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along  and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible  even making fire from ice . tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear  but whenever the bear is present  the characters lose all sensibility . i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . thankfully  we already have begun to care for the characters  and so we let this small detail slide . but some of the technical details are awkward  such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature  and borders on phenomenal . anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance  creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles  but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy  something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . baldwin can be a good or a bad character  and here he succeeds at both in a way . you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end  and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . elle macpherson gives a good performance  albeit slight . she isn't in the film all that much  but for the scenes she does have  she handles as an actress  not as a model . harold perrineau is a good actor  and his scenes are nice and underplayed . he is eliminated early  and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . the edge is rated r for graphic violence  some gore  and language . some of the violence is a little too disturbing  even for me . this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to  but too many cliches bog it down . director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . david mamet's script  though  has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat  and the acting is solid . the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action sequence  but with a small detail involving a certain gift . it's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . and by the way  most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . way to go  bart . reviewed by respect ( respect@aros . net ) http : //www . aros . net/~respect/movies . html

" truman ( "" true-man "" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film . president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide  in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . "" truman "" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war  an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . and burbank  california  brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . if hollywood is the center of the film world  burbank is  or was  the center of tv's world  the world where our protagonist lives . combine all these names and concepts into "" truman burbank  "" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . truman leads the perfect life . his town  his car  and his wife are picture perfect . his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . . . but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? the next day during the drive to work  the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . when the radio comes back to normal  the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . his suspicion aroused  he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door  made to look like the back of an elevator  into place . two security guards grab him and throw him out . truman is really suspicious now . it gets even worse the next day when his wife  a nurse  describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . "" it's best not to think about it  "" she says  trying vainly to change truman's memory . truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program . his actions are "" real "" but everything else is carefully scripted  from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . meanwhile  christof  the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view  or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view . we root for the captive of the cage-world . our protagonist is counting on "" chaos theory "" to help him escape his elaborate trap . the story  written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca )  introduces some interesting questions  such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life  or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . although these questions came to mind  i don't think the film itself asked them . it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them . i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show . carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain  but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . the two seemed exclusive of one another  but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't  but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . but on its own terms  the movie is well made . sight  sound and pacing are all handled competently . much of the first part of the movie is the truman show . the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras  with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio  the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . the music is well-chosen and scored . the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music  when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect . when the movie ends  the score sounds more like a frantic  driven  tangerine dream opus  while still keeping the same timbre . philip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening . ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) and the pacing of the story was brisk . there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show  just a few quick title cards  a few interviews  and then right into the show  and the movie . one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart  because it wasn't necessary  we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble  and no sooner . there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . it's a quick  straight shot to the movie's end . in terms of overall quality  i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film "" clicked "" and became an instant classic . nevertheless  i look forward to niccol's next film  whatever it may be . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/

"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . lives are often at stake  and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable  prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor  psychologist  and sham artist  in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence  or failing that  must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . most of all  the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible  and quickly gain control of the situation  dominate the conversation  and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . it takes a pretty smart person to do that . but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? what if he's also able to think on his feet ? in fact  what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . in this film  police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home  roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . faced with the scorn of most of the police department  and under close scrutiny by the media  roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . i don't quite remember if the captain actually said  "" i hate to do this  but . . . ""  although it wouldn't surprise me if he did . luckily  the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney  roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . walsh )  taking him and others hostage  and proclaiming he has been framed . although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up  gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . jackson  while a superb actor  is miscast in the role of roman . the actor has become so popular  and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found  such as in jackie brown )  that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage  no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? unfortunately  this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments  and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . almost every time he's in a scene  jackson steals it without looking back . when spacey appears  the film has already run about a third of its course . his is an interesting character . made out to be some kind of negotiating superman  our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower  but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone  "" he says . when he gets the call to action  however  he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . soon  his character has to negotiate not only with roman  but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out  all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation  should negotiations fail . this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . as the second protagonist  spacey measures up nicely . gray really lucked out with this cast . david morse as commander beck  ron rifkin as commander frost  and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent  and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock  rifkin played the d . a . in l . a . confidential  and spencer played a police detective in cop land . with the level of acting  however  this can be forgiven . also in the supporting cast  paul giamatti as rudy  one of the hostages  is notable for the comic relief he provides . his character is initially so slimy  and giamatti himself just looks so shifty  that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . fortunately  this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film  but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . j . t . walsh  as the suspicious internal affairs inspector  clocks in with one of his final performances . sadly  the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year  and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam  backdraft  and nixon . for one of his best performances  check out sling blade  in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march  walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh  and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role  it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . in the end  the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . as an audience  we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie  and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . both provide some pretty good entertainment .

"conflict is overrated . too many screenwriters who have based their work on the numerous books that teach you how to write a screenplay step by step feel the need to inject conflict at every possible moment . at first sight is a good example of this . there are so many things about this film that work so well  but at times the forced conflict is so embarrasingly mindless it made me cringe . at first sight is based on a story by oliver sacks about restored sight . in the film  val kilmer plays virgil adamson  a man who has been blind since he was 3 . he works as a masseuse at a vacation resort . this is where he bumps into architect amy benic ( sorvino ) . these early scenes between them are nothing short of fantastic . kilmer and sorvino have a dynamic chemistry  and the film could've simply focused on their romance the entire running time and be successful . but i know that's not the only story irwin winkler wants to tell . this film is also about how a blind man copes with restored sight . there is nothing wrong with this  considering the early scenes here are also quite effective . bruce davison is a doctor who performs a surgery to help virgil restore his sight . virgil's first moments of sight are very frightening  since has has no idea what exactly he is looking at . the moments of this story i enjoyed most dealt with virgil attempting to make sense of what he is seeing . for example  he knows what an apple looks like  but he can't tell the difference between a real apple and a picture of an apple . virgil is aided by visual therapist phil webster ( nathan lane ) . lane's performance is very good  but i wish there was more of his character here . i would've preferred more scenes of human interaction and therapy between virgil and phil than dull lectures from bruce davison's character . but that's only a minor problem . the film's two biggest flaws are the introduction of two minor characters that didn't need to be in this story . steven webber plays sorvino's ex-husband and boss . first of all  it's hard to beleive these two were ever married  and it's even harder to beleive that their breakup wouldve been amicable enough for her to still want to work for him . but conflict is necessary says these screenwriting books  and the screenplay makes the major mistake of presenting webber's character as a threat to virgil and amy's romance . this guy is the most pathetic and pointless character since john pankow in the object of my affection . any scene he is in shakes the credibility of the entire film . another misconceived character comes in the form of virgil's father . he left virgil many years ago when he couldn't find a cure for his blindness . when he learns of virgil's restored sight  he tries to arrange a meeting between them . i don't care about this . the father is a throwaway character who we only see in two scenes  but the film asks us to find the scene between them touching and sad . it's just a mindless way to inject more conflict for virgil than was necessary . instead  why couldn't the film give a better subplot for virgil's sister ( very well played by kelly mcgillis ) ? . she has seemingly devoted her entire life to taking care of virgil  so why not show scenes where she wonders about her future without virgil ? now that he's with amy  she no longer has anyone to come home to and take care of . scenes like this would've been more touching than a lame father- son reunion . the film does hint at this once  but it's quickly abandoned . yet once again this year  i enjoyed a film despite the appearance of several major flaws . if the allure of the friday night lights propelled varsity blues past it's flaws  then what works here is the powerful romance between virgil and amy . mira sorvino is a terrific actress  and this performance is among her best . she has a natural ability to show how much she cares for someone without even having to say a word . val kilmer abandons his usual brooding  egotistical style of performance and instead creates a character that he actually seems to care about . virgil is sweet  funny  smart  and even infuriating . kilmer is able to bring out all these traits perfectly  which is certainly more impressive than the simple technical task of looking like a blind person . together  they have immense chemistry and are able to carry the entire film past even it's most gaping of flaws .

" 1998  r  170 minutes [2 hours  50 minutes]starring : tom hanks ( captain miller ) ; tom sizemore ( sergeant horvath )  edward burns ( private reiben )  jeremy davies ( corporal upham ) ; written by robert rodat ; produced by ian bryce  mark gordon  gary levinsohn ; steven spielberg ; directed by steven spielberg . seen august 8  1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam  ny )  theater #6  by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . [theater rating : * * * : good seats  sound  and picture] war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies  documentaries  and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on  such as strategy  politics  and victory . it's easy to forget war  in its most basic form  is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier  no matter what his rank or importance  is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect  especially in its unapologetic  realistic delivery . it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing . the film opens with one of the most graphic  disturbing scenes in recent memory . it's world war ii  d-day to be exact  and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . instead of positioned cameras  the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . there is no sense of stability  but of constant  anxious  and confusing motion  giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle  and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles  but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated  but as people that must be destroyed because they're there . in the movies  the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch  but in reality that wouldn't happen . the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who  what  and where they're shooting  unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are  but that seems to be part of the theme . the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism  that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil . "" the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression )  and begin to inflict some damage . i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up  i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief . to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure  but there's nothing cliche about the graphic  detailed  atmosphere here because it really happened . one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is  and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . tom hanks stars as captain miller  a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . he's never obsessive or any such generic  cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . he doesn't want to be there any more than his men  but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . the mission the film is concerned with is  as the title states  saving private ryan . through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker  it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously . when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe  they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . it's easy to sympathize with this situation  after all  no one should have to lose all their children at once . but finding one man in this war is  as miller puts it  "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . "" the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device  but a thematic one . his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country  the world even  was trying to convince itself it still had . when miller's company hears of the mission  they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead  but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off . he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope  and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality . the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination  but not direction . along the way many things happen to them  both good and bad . a few battles are fought  not to be major accomplishments for the war  but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors . the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle  but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go  they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . unfortunately  death is a fact of war  and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters  but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible . in fact  only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man  and the performances are good enough to make this method work . although the characters are somewhat typical  the actors maintain control over the material at all time . whether they're arguing with each other  telling stories of back home  or fighting the germans  they never go overboard and always seem believable . sure  there's a zinger here and there  but war doesn't change the fact boys will be boys . if and when one dies we too can feel the loss  even though we hardly knew them . the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous  violent battle sequence . private ryan has been found  but facing four to one odds  can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? that's not a premise for thrills  it's symbolic of everything the film has worked for . it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending  it ends the way it must end . i remember reading a "" calvin & hobbes "" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like  "" dad  how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ?

"disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . to see a disaster film with actual originality  or at least a decent plot twist  would definitely be a welcome surprise . unfortunately  folks  it's not likely . dante's peak is cliched  and at times corny  but also pretty decent . to be honest  i wasn't very interested in seeing this film  and word of mouth  as well as several reviews  didn't make it sound promising . so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all . it's pretty run of the mill  but it's not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch . in case you don't know  dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow  dante's peak ( who would've guessed  eh ? ) . pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and  perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof  is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . due to the lack of more substantial evidence  nobody warns the small town  and when they finally do  it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . brosnan  all around good guy  will  of course  save the day . . . or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) . naturally the two will become infatuated with one another .

"david mamet is a good director . mamet's an even better screenwriter and playwright . the guy's authored some of the best film and theatre works in the past decade -- the verdict  house of games  wag the dog  state and main  and the guy even won a pulitzer prize for his play glengarry glen ross . with that said  it's such a shame that his latest crime caper  heist  falls apart by employing too many of the well-known devices of a mamet production -- double-crossing femmes fatale  overtly memorable characters  and deceptive plot lines . but movies like the spanish prisoner  things change  and the winslow boy display a roundness to mamet's innate abilities . and it's almost a crime to witness how all of that goes awry in his latest film  heist . heist twists and turns along the road of documenting the shady life of career jewel thief joe moore ( gene hackman ) and his posse of thieves -- bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) and don "" pinky "" pincus ( ricky jay ) . during a raid on a jewelry store  moore ends up with his mug on the surveillance cameras and he goes on the lam from the local marshals . he decides to get out of dodge with his recent bride fran ( rebecca pidgeon  looking like a cross between sharon stone and joan crawford )  sailing into the sunset on his yacht . the only problem is that his fence bergman ( danny devito ) has set up a big score -- the swiss job -- which he wants done so badly he holds joe's cut of the jewelry heist on layaway until the swiss job is done . to ensure his faithful hound brings the goods home intact  bergman tosses his nephew jimmy silk ( sam rockwell ) into joe's crew for observation purposes . things become complicated when joe's wife has an affair with jimmy  the swiss job turns sour  devito starts acting like his character from ruthless people  and ricky jay starts looking for the exit to this mess of a film . a mamet production usually derives its success from a solid emotional attachment to its characters -- usually they've been wronged and are seeking justice or absolution . the naïve scientist from the spanish prisoner or the curious psychologist from house of games were just decent people we recognize in our everyday lives . when those people get royally screwed over  its human nature to desire retribution . heist lacks any such emotional attachment . of greater concern is the recycling of plot points from ronin  which mamet also wrote and which deals with a similar plot involving double-crossing thieves on the run . to save the day  though  heist carries some of the best actors working today . devito  lindo  and hackman chew up and spit out the scenery around them . sam rockwell -- who usually plays naïve and jovial characters in movies like galaxy quest -- plays silk as cold  manipulative  and downright spooky . but the main problem with heist is how surprisingly predictable the story is . unlike the similar yet far superior the score  there's never any surprise during heist's twisting . mamet has just become lazy with this one . everything about the film looks great  but there's nothing at all underneath . reviewed as part of our coverage of the 24th annual mill valley film festival .

"united kingdom/united states  1997 u . s . release date : 12/25/97 ( limited ) running length : 1 : 50 mpaa classification : r ( profanity  mature themes  brief nudity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 cast : phylida law  emma thompson  gary hollywood  arlene cockburn  sheila reid  sandra voe  douglas murphy  sean biggerstaff director : alan rickman producers : ken lipper  edward r . pressman  steve clark-hall screenplay : sharman macdonald and alan rickman cinematography : seamus mcgarvey music : michael kamen u . s . distributor : fine line features anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . however  for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves  this recognition may be something of a shock . nevertheless  "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director  the winter guest . the film has a simple  unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole . the result is an occasionally haunting  sometimes magical  and always insightful human drama . the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale  nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure  there is no real beginning or end . instead  we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . they represent both sexes  multiple generations  and a variety of relationships  male and female ; young  middle-aged  and elderly ; friends  would-be lovers  and kin . we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed  emotional boundaries eroded  and truths unveiled . there is comedy and tragedy . most importantly  much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives  in this fiction can be found much truth . the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach  giving the terrain an alien appearance . it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . there are four pairings  and  although there is some interaction between the different twosomes  the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . the first  meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter  frances ( emma thompson ) . these two have a stormy relationship . they love each other deeply  but both are stubborn and willful  and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . much of their interaction is argumentative  but  during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline  they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . frances' adult son  alex ( gary hollywood )  is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . on this day  he meets a girl  nita ( arlene cockburn )  who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him )  both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . once they retire to a place where they can be alone  however  things don't go exactly as planned . lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . death is a topic of endless fascination for them  perhaps because they are so close to it  and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries  looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased . it's the ceremony that they're interested in . sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff )  a pair of schoolboy chums  are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach  horsing around  building a small fire for warmth  and walking on the frozen water . unlike lily and chloe  these two have their entire lives ahead of them . they are young enough to still believe in magic  but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . the acting is strong and believable . the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective  with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different  non-related actors . and  of course  the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995  with rickman as the director . four of the film's principals  phylida law  arlene cockburn  sheila reid  and sandra voe  appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays  the winter guest has been successfully opened up . the rough  bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . in fact  considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope  it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . if you appreciate character studies  the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .

"" the big lebowski "" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that "" fargo "" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film  "" lebowski "" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over  but thankfully never does . the coens ( joel directed  ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale  and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence  "" the big lebowski "" is immensely lively . there are those who will dislike this film  but not because it's boring . the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given . bridges exudes a likeable  surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn't the cleanest guy around  but you'd still follow him to another movie . goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration  as walter's manic temper is one of "" the big lebowski "" 's many highlights ; the same goes for moore  whose throaty  delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . sam elliott's rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . and some will recognize peter stormare -- "" fargo "" 's silent heavy -- as carl hungus  a porn star who's really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star . only in its final third does the movie falter  with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . these flaws are forgivable  though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it's hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . without a doubt  "" the big lebowski "" is the best film so far this year . sure  we're only three months in and the competition ( "" deep rising  "" "" desperate measures  "" "" the wedding singer  "" etc . ) has been pretty bland  but it's still the gospel truth . maybe during next awards season  "" lebowski "" won't be a far cry from "" fargo .

"scream 2  directed by wes craven . written by kevin williamson . starring neve campbell  courtney cox  david arquette . only a year after the initial release of "" scream  "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre  the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters . while the tongue-in-cheek  parodic element is still noticeable in this film  it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . the first film  while often violent and gruesome  was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab  "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream  "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . its conclusion  in which a bleeding  wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt  is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and  interestingly enough  how they are usually inferior to their predecessors )  the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning  and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time . more importantly  this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact  the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense )  weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety  and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . understandably  "" scream 2 "" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies  but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . couple that with the fact that several of the characters  most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell )  are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense  and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and  in one case  a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . while i have not seen any of his other work  it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director  as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . unfortunately  "" scream 2 "" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . for example  several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick  but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . . . well  it's hard to say . i gave the first "" scream "" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . "" scream 2 "" bounces all over the place stylistically  but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . i'm not sure which is the better movie  but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels  however much randy might argue  do not necessarily suck .

" directed by mimi leder starring george clooney  nicole kidman  armin-mueller stahl  michael lures  randall batinkoff  michael boatman mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . her mast famous episode  "" love's labour lost ""  dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies . so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . and i have to say  after a shaky beginning  she does not disappoint . peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists  which is obviously nothing new . the first half hour goes into detail  way too much detail  about how the weapons are stolen . despite a few good images  including a train collision and a very impressive explosion  none of this was very coherent . it's long and drawn out  and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture  it begins to take off . george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two  but that is dispensed with quickly . the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe  trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm  frustration  determination  and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . this is when leder starts to show her true stuff . she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer . then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city's crowded streets  and a madman with a nuke walking among them . mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense . she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking . nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero . you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . george clooney is a real movie star . many of you may have hated him as batman  but this guy is for real . he has a natural screen presence  and an ingratiating personality . he'll be around for a while . dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .

"release date : january 22  1999 starring : emily watson  rachel griffiths  david morrissey  james frain  charles dance  celia imrie directed by : anand tucker distributed by : october films mpaa rating : r ( language  sexuality ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/hilary . htm not since 1996's shine  which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott  has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . in fact  if one were to watch these films together  it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . yet hilary and jackie  the sophomore effort from director anand tucker  has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale  playing the sisters du pré . both musicians from childhood  hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women  both together and seperate . their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's  and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . they contrast each other wonderfully  and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pré is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic  both characters are charged with emotion . the frank cottrell boyce script  which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pré  brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . the script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature . cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least  and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . nevertheless  hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around .

"director : brad silberling || screenplay : dana stevens ( based on an original screenplay by wim wenders and peter handke ) || stars : nicolas cage ( seth )  meg ryan ( maggie )  andré braugher ( cassiel )  dennis franz ( messinger )  colm feore ( jordan )  robin bartlett ( anne )  joanna merlin ( teresa ) || mpaa rating : pg-13 there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels  "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst  gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . the camera moves above them  showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women  all garbed in black . then the camera moves in on the face of seth  an angel played by nicolas cage  and as the sun rises  he smiles and his entire face lights up . you see  the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets  but they cannot feel a human touch . it is an important scene for several reasons . first of all  it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth  watching what goes on with little interference . there are none of the standard  hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 ) . the angels here are stark and believable . this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition  for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot  and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures  like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs  or the smell of the salt in the air . there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel  although there is much beauty in it as well . they eternally walk the earth  listening to our thoughts  touching us in our pain  and leading the dying to heaven . like human existence  being an angel is often confused and unsure . "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story  between seth and a human  a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . he first sees her when he is in her operating room  waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . maggie is distraught  doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table  and seth is moved by her efforts and  more importantly  her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain  and seth does what he can with his invisible touch  but it's not enough . he wants to be with her and share her pain  not just stand back at a distance . he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human . he learns this from another fallen angel  played by dennis franz ( "" n . y . p . d . blue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance . sitting at a diner together  franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food  feel another person's skin  smell the air  and most importantly  have a loving wife and children . of course  there is pain to go along with all this  but for seth  it will be worth it . "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire . "" wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling  the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles  and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . and  unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare  it doesn't suffer extensive damage . this may be because director brad silberling ( "" casper "" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( "" blink "" ) wanted to make "" city of angels "" its own movie - inspired by "" wings of desire  "" but not an attempt to copy it . and yet  "" city of angels "" is not a typical hollywood movie . it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( "" the english patient "" )  whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene  there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around  looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . while the film travels along a charted plot  it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly  and shows just how thin those boundaries are . both cage and ryan give soulful  soft-spoken performances . ryan  who is usually so bouncy and energetic  truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple  heartfelt gazes  and speaks with the comforting  knowing voice that only an angel could have . what is most striking about "" city of angels "" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay  which is both unexpected and challenging . it's not a formulaic hollywood ending  because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . it doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . instead  it offers something much better  something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . ____________________________________________ visit "" charlie don't surf !

"by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) zero effect gets its title from the main character  daryl zero ( bill pullman )  although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . zero is a private investigator  perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) . however  he's a socially inept being  and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller )  a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator . the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) . it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box  and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . zero takes the case  and the plot thickens . his path leads to a young  pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence  she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . through his investigations  zero learns why  but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that  because of his reclusive behavior  are new and confusing to him . i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators  and  every once in a while  a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually  no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) . zero effect  which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director  is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original  funny  and completely involving motion picture . with so many cliches available to this genre  i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here  one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . take  for starters  the great cast of characters . pullman is terrific as zero  showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs . zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted  emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance  and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . "" i'll shoot you  "" he says to stark at one point . "" i have a gun  and everything . "" his character is also well-drawn  with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens  last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising  gets a chance to show us her talent here  giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken  and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is  an how that makes him such a great detective . what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed  or standing motionlessly  with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face  his eyes pointing to something off camera  but obviously to nothing in particular . i can't convey to you how funny this is  but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent  and they provide solid characterization of zero . as a side note  i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not  and vice versa . there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film  and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone  but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . jake kasdan  son of writer/director lawrence kasdan  is only 22 years old . i found this out after seeing the film  and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . his direction is stylish without being pretentious  and his writing is mature  full  and developed . zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart  original films like this are rare as it is  but this one actually has a heart and a soul . at the end of the film  i was involved in the characters  and i was satisfied with the outcome . and  with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age  all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .

"" obviously  the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? no  of course not  and it never aspires to be anything more . much like derek  zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy  and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles  wild characters and performances  and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . better yet  this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia  since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . enter derek  whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . on the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor )  and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . much like the austin powers films  zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved  and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . wilson is hysterical as the young  vain hansel . ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant  freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . jerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein . even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged  large-assed masseuse . as for ben stiller  it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid  which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . unfortunately  taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . maybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies )  making her unbelievable as a dowdy  brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years . she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo  who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role . while zoolander is hardly highbrow  its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times  especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . zoolander's no masterpiece  but a very worthy distraction .

"bob the happy bastard's quickie review : what's worse than y2k ? how about a fully digital future where nothing is real ? that's what computer programmer neo ( keanu reeves ) slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix  a movie directed by the wachowski brothers ( the guys behind the hip thriller bound ) . before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role  hold on . there's actually a story with depth here . it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix  led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss  who looks quite cool in leather  i must say . neo ( reeves ) is pretty much a key player in this fight  although he really doesn't look it at first . could this amateur be "" the one "" as fisburne thinks he is ? credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build  something that few special effects-laden films seem to do these days . there's plenty of effects to go around  of course  but at least there's a backbone to build them on as well . reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo  particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy  yet great . i wish the villains weren't quite so "" generic "" ( leftover g-men from looking for a sweet sci-fi actioner with plenty of stop-motion swooping camera angles and  of course  a motherlode of a helicopter explosion . now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project . bring it on .

"the ability to suspend ones disbelief is a vital trait when attending a schwarzengger movie . however  due to the absence of a good film from the big austrian for quite some time  people seem to have forgotten this . the biggest complaint i hear about "" end of days "" is that it was unbelievable . i'm sorry  but i personally believe it is incredibly naive to expect arnold to appear in a realistic film . twenty years ago  a newborn girl was chosen by a satanic cult to be the one who would bear the child of satan . now  young christine ( robin tunney ) is grown up and is being stalked by three different groups : two church factions  one intent on killing her ; and the other  led by father kovak ( rod steiger )  attempting to protect and hide her ; the third party is satan himself  possessing the body of a wall street banker ( gabriel byrne ) . drawn into the conflict are jericho cane ( arnold schwarzenegger ) and chicago ( kevin pollak )  two bodyguards hired by the man they do not know to be satan . as cane is drawn deeper and deeper into the conflict  he learns that christine must not be impregnated or the world will come to an end . if you don't like arnold movies  chances are you already know to steer clear of this one . if this somehow hasn't occured to you  let me reassure you that this is a schwarzenegger film in the truest sense  so stay far away . being a typical film of the schwarzenegger genre  this movie is a whole lot of fun  but be sure to leave your brain and sense of logic at the door . there are more plot holes here than i can begin to count . this movie isn't about plot though . it's about fight scenes  explosions and special effects . these are certainly present in abundance . on the down side  the acting here is certainly less than phenomenal from the leads . as all know  arnold isn't going to get any oscar nominations in the near future . however  he is charismatic enough to get away with this . robin tunney  on the other hand  is likely to get nominated for at least one award  and that's the razzie . not only is she laughably bad in this role  but she looks utterly dumbfounded as to what she's supposed to be doing half the time . as for the rest of the cast  rod steiger is as good as ever ; kevin pollak is certainly in his element as a smart alec of a side-kick ; and cch pounder  a remarkable actress  is woefully underused as a police detective . the real standout performance here comes from gabriel byrne as the man ( this is how he's credited ) himself . byrne simply oozes charm and authority . watch for a scene in which he meets a skateboarder who disrespects him . "" end of days "" is mindless movie fun nearly at its best . it doesn't quite make it because the film does border on being too mindless at times . some of the scenes we are expected to swallow will have you gawking at the screen in disbelief ( such as how cane discovers the existence of christine ) . if you think you can get past this  just sit back  relax  and enjoy . "" end of days "" runs a touch too long at 120 minutes . i give it three and a half stars  and a recommendation to catch a matinee . feel free to e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made  see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie  hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you've got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain .

"cast : kim novak  james garner  tony randall  howard morris  howard duff  oskar homolka i love this movie  and i've just seen for the umptenth time . unfortunately  it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it . it's my mission in life to spread the word : see this movie ! fred  george  doug and howie are reaching middleage . three of them have a wife  kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay . only fred is still a bachelor . together they take the local train every morning to work in town . on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar  fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress . he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night . since they always split everything four ways  they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well  kathy . however  kathy isn't completly honest to them . in fact  she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male . with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper . ok  have one thing clear though . the romantic rendezvous' between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent . the script stays above the waist - or to be precise  above the neck . noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress  the four guys call her their 'companion' . the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above 15 years  but that only shows how long ago 1962 was . small children could watch this without being corrupted . kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie  even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student . james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies . i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife . tony randall is funny as always . 1962 was more than 35 years ago . how many accountants  copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work ? this is the white middle class  i can't remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use . these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves . perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology ?

"jake kasdan  son of one of the best screenwriters around  breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery  part comedy  part character study and part romance . for the most part  kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin )  and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines  rather than morphine ) . he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces  the case about the man who lied about his age  or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment  though it makes him a brilliant private investigator  makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson  i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . arlo is not happy with his job . he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance  but his bizarre behavior  and strange requests  are frustrating to the former lawyer . and they're even more so to his girlfriend  jess ( angela featherstone )  who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her . this is the situation when a new case comes knocking . gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring  and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . now  stark is being blackmailed  and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . to solve this case  zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . however  this is when he is vulnerable . . . and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic  gloria sullivan ( kim dickens )  who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . for the first time  zero has to question his own objectivity  as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . zero effect is weakest in its obviously "" wacky "" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior . such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire  making zero an ace ventura-ish character . however  there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film . in fact  some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . however  the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film  and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own . once the investigation is underway  however  zero's brilliance really begins to shine . his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own . as the mystery begins to unfold  zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions  but never lose the viewer . zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . zero's relationship with gloria is low-key  but it hits all the right notes . however  we are always kept distant from gloria's character . she's given plenty of development  but we never understand what she is thinking . perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment . but  on the whole  it is frustrating . bill pullman  when he's not spacing out  creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . there's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years  and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character  but one which fits in well . and  although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called "" zero "" seriously  it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . although zero effect is a bit awkward in places  it is a strong debut for kasdan  and shows great promise .

"bob the happy bastard's quickie review : brendan fraser's stuck in the past again  but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . fraser is the lead star of the mummy  the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film  and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages  like boris karloff was engulfed in . but who cares  the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from  oh  say  godzilla or armageddon . fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . basically  it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . his plan- wake back up and wake her up also  making him invincible . of course  fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna )  along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j . o'connor ) and some "" americans "" . . . and guess what ? yup  ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . fire flies from the sky  flesh-eating beetles crawl about  and  well  ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold . ok  so it's not really all that new a story  but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch  and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either . the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . no  it's no phantom menace beater  but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season  you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy . if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man  then nothing will .

"member of the 'internet movie critics association' http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html 'lethal weapon 4' is the film mel gibson said he would never do . never say never . with a pay cheque of 20 million dollars and a guarantee of 20 per cent of the film's earnings  "" never "" is a word the isn't found in mel's vocabulary . this is a film made for one reason and one reason only : pure profit ! that is always the case with sequels but in the case of warner brothers  it is particularly a show of desperation since they have had a number of flops recently and need a hit badly . i don't have a problem with movie sequels because in many ways  they're equivalent to visiting an old friend as you come back for more and more fun each time . 'lethal weapon 4' isn't a terrible movie  it's just one too many and the franchise is starting to show one thing : age ! mel gibson  danny glover  joe pesci and rene russo are all starting to show signs of aging . not too badly but in comparison to the other films : a lot . as 'lethal weapon 4' opens  the streets of l . a . are once again endangered  this time by a psychotic  protected with body armor who fires automatic rounds and shots from a flame-thrower in any direction he pleases . riggs and murtaugh ( gibson and glover ) eventually put a stop to his antics with humourous results and the film move forward from there . the central plot of 'lethal weapon 4' is an immigrant smuggling ring run by an old asian warlord whose right hand man ( jet li ) is a cool and frightening martial arts expert who silences his enemies by putting his moves on them . some of the immigrants brought to america are to work as slaves and murtaugh takes a family under his wing and has them live at home with his wife and children as a way of understanding how slavery affected his ancestors . all the while illegal but definitely the humane thing to do . riggs and his girlfriend lorna ( rene russo ) are expecting a baby any day now  as is murtaugh's daughter who is married to a cop ( chris rock )  a man who works with riggs and murtaugh and a man murtaugh doesn't know is married to his daughter because she was afraid to tell him since he was always against her marrying a cop . murtaugh later finds out about his new son-in-law while getting high on some dentist's laughing gas and the humour is what has always saved these movies from falling into the abyss . this movie certainly stays within the tradition of slick action movies with the key emphasis being on the word "" slick "" . the slickest and best installment of all the 'lethal weapon' movies is #2 which had the most bruising story and climax of all . it also introduced us to joe pesci as leo getz who became the comic relief of the series and although his character was badly used in #3  he is better this time around . director richard donner keeps the movie alive with well photographed and edited scenes of action and ranks as one of the action genre's most talented contributors . i'll probably put 'lethal weapon 4' in my video collection for the sake of uniting it with other members of its family but i'll probably watch it the least as it is the least of all the 'lethal weapon' movies  without hesitation .

"oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . at the same time he creates a very human character  a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics  which is here pictured as a wild animal . he is simply trying to tame it . but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them . stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon . he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself  the system that  once set in motion  behaves with a mindlessness of its own . "" nixon "" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film  there is no gloating  but a watery sigh  as of a great ship sinking . sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding  creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president . joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette . she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . the rest of the cast is equally magnificent  including : james woods  j . t . walsh  paul sorvino  ed harris and bob hoskins . everyone does a serious and demanding job  no one are disappointing . stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy  honest and determined . he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood . the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin  robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .

( i couldn't help thinking that meyer would have had endless fun with a scene where one of them explains her ambitions to eventually enter law school  making love to a support pillar during the whole conversation . ) after meeting up with a whitebread-innocent couple  varla ( tura satana ) gets fed up with being one-upped  and kills the guy with a few well-placed karate blows . they kidnap the girl and keep her sedated while trying to figure out what to do next -- although it sort of hits them over the head : at a gas station  they learn than a weird old cripple and his sons live in the area  harboring a massive fortune . no prizes for guessing what happens next . the movie's loaded with things that have since become pop-cinema staples : bizarre camera angles and editing  improbable character pairings  bizarre fights . one of the most memorable scenes has satana vs . one of the old man's sons . she's trying to run him into a wall with her speedster  and he's holding her car at bay with his bare hands  the wheels digging a huge ditch . satana's idea of karate has nothing on jackie chan  but it's not hard to see how a woman using violence against a man in the late sixties  on-screen  could be construed as * really * shocking . she isn't flashy ; she's trying to do damage . she means business . as the model ( or at least the center of inspiration ) for the rest of the women in the film  tura satana eats up the screen without even trying . she reminds me of the extremely fetishistic  almost representational ways women are depicted in x-rated japanese manga : gigantic chest  mask-like face  drill-instructor's voice . she reportedly received a deluge of fan mail after the movie came out  mostly from men who either wanted to marry her or be flogged by her . most of the reason you can't look away from the screen is her  and it's not because she's attractive  or even sexy . she's terrifying  especially when meyer shoves the camera down on the desert floor  somewhere between her toes  and has her stare down at us . what we wind up with  incredibly  is probably the wellspring of almost every butch-femme empowerment image . i'm not sure madonna or pat califa would exist as we know them  without something like faster  pussycat ! as part of the ambient background noise in american culture . then again  maybe i'm crediting him with too much . but then i watched ralph fiennes get the cheese kicked out of him by a green-haired punk girl in strange days  and thought : maybe too much credit isn't nearly enough ! -----== posted via deja news  the leader in internet discussion ==----- http : //www . dejanews . com/ now offering spam-free web-based newsreading

" at first glance  it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . but home alone actually has a lot going for it  and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . the mcalisters  all 15 of them  are going to france for the holidays . four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . the littlest kid  kevin  is the victim of the older kids' cruelty . kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten  and he's going to have to starve . he attacks his big bully brother buzz  who had been teasing him . the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner  spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table  a few cousins  and an uncle . the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased  but they all point their fingers when he fights back . the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . on his way up the stairs  he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . that night the power goes out  knocking out the alarm clocks  so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . in a surprisingly plausible setup  kevin is mistakenly accounted for  and the family heads off without him . it's interesting that  in a subtle way  his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling  and second  they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . meanwhile  kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . he's finally rid of his family ! life is a dream come true . he can jump on the beds  watch r-rated movies  eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips  and dig through his big brother's secret box . slowly  the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . he grooms himself  he does the laundry  he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk  eggs  and fabric softener "" ) . he also starts to miss his family  not just for their company  but for the security they bring . the furnace in the basement is a scary monster  the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer  and two crooks are trying to break into his house . macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor . still  we can see that kevin's character grows  thanks to some good direction and editing . for example  acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night  just as "" santa "" is getting in his car . kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . he learned how to deal with the furnace . you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore . he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer  who actually turns out to be a nice man . they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . finally  in the last 20 minutes  kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits  head on ( literally ) . this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick  and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup  it is dessert . it's a lot of fun  and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . on the whole  home alone is a great holiday movie . john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls  and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . but it does have its flaws . the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . as i said before  he is cute  but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character . the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda  the villains threaten kevin's life about five times . instead of "" i'm gonna get that kid "" they say "" i'm gonna kill that kid . "" some might argue that the tone is the same  but i strongly disagree . mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . i'll probably never see home alone 3  and i wish i had skipped home alone 2  but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original  which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/

"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project  making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . this new film has been underrated for no reason . it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films . it is also more psychological  pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters . the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score  the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children . more than all money and power on earth  you are my treasure "" . the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . constantly haunted by the past  his only reason to live is his children . the family has amassed unimaginable wealth  and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . later that day  at a reception  his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily  "" a check in the amount of $100 million . "" but the corleones are about to find  as others have throughout history  that you cannot buy forgiveness . sure  you can do business with evil men inside the church  for all men are fallible and capable of sin . but god does not take payoffs . the plot of the movie  concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines  brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . there is a moment in "" godfather iii "" where michael says : "" all my life i have been trying to go up in society  where everything was legal . but the higher i go  the crookier it becomes . . "" . visually this film is as spectacular as the first two . gordon willis' rich cinematography  carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better . but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep  intellectual plots  tree dimensional characters and incredible acting  than for their visual perfection . the third installment has only the plot and visuals . some characters could be much more developed and the acting  although good  never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla  who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie  that could have been grander and more emotional . the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino  who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son  strong  focused and loyal . violence is natural to him . he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf  and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends  that you remember from the first and second films . in the third film michael has become almost like his father  vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed . many have pointed out that making the third film  was unnecessary . i disagree . it is a beautiful film of great importance  completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life . it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . a man desperately trying to keep his balance  focus  family and sanity  while everything is crashing all around him . the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life . the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . there is no turning back . and no matter how hard you try to get out of it  to free yourself  no matter how powerful and wealthy you are  you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film  when michael is sitting alone in his chair  left by everyone  surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . here he dies - alone  miserable and unforgiven

"directed by gregory hoblit . screenplay by tobias emmerich . starring dennis quaid  james caviezel  elizabeth mitchell . running time : 121 minutes . rated aa by the mfcb . reviewed on may 4th  2000 . one of the big problems with many movies about changing history is that they tend to get bogged down in its mechanics . the difficulty is that our modern understanding of time is still incredibly limited  so any such discussion will by its very nature come across as a load of gobbledegook . good movies like "" back to the future "" ignore the subject altogether  or at most give it a passing acknowledgement . their makers are aware that the fun thing about time isn't how it works  but how it can be used in a dramatic context . "" frequency "" is such a film  and it proves to be one of the most entertaining movies of the year so far . john sullivan ( james caviezel ) is a cop in 1999 new york . he has just broken up with his girlfriend  drinks a little too much  and is all too aware that it's almost the thirtieth anniversary of the death of his father . frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) was a firefighter who perished in 1969 rescuing a transient from a warehouse fire . one night  john happens upon his dad's old ham radio  mothballed since frank's demise . for old times' sake  he switches it on . a lot of things were happening in new york around the time of frank's death . the "" amazing "" mets were on their way to winning the world series against the baltimore orioles . a serial killer murdered four nurses before vanishing without a trace . and the aurora borealis -- the northern lights -- was making a rare week-long appearance in the skies above the city . in 1999  the northern lights have returned to new york for the first time in three decades . by some freak accident of nature  this allows john to speak to frank in 1969 via the ham radio . john manages to convince his father that he really is communicating from the future by predicting events of the mets/orioles world series  and gives him enough information about the warehouse fire to save his life . but this changes the whole pattern of history  and not all for the good . somehow  frank's survival has meant that the so-called nightingale killer's death toll was ten instead of four -- and one of the "" new "" victims was john's mother julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) . frank and john must cooperate across the years to stop the murderer in time . "" frequency "" is not a particularly deep movie . in a way it's about the relationship between fathers and sons  and how profoundly the absence of the former can affect the latter . and of course it deals with the familiar science-fiction notion of how changing one seemingly innocuous event can have major ramifications on things long after . but  in the end  the real point of "" frequency "" is just to tell a good story  and in this it excels . there are a lot of great scenes in which frank and john's altering of history is explored  not on a pseudoscientific level but on a purely visceral one . the movie doesn't try to justify its temporal mechanics ( indeed  there are some inconsistencies in how frank's actions ripple down to his son )  but just taps into our sense of the fantastic . for example  at one point frank communicates with john by burning a message into his desk . john sees the letters appear one by one and touches them  expecting to find them hot . but of course they're not  because they were made thirty years earlier . later  frank acquires a wallet with the murderer's fingerprints on it  but can't go to the police in 1969 because they'd never believe his story . so he hides the wallet beneath a loose floorboard  where john retrieves it in 1999 . "" wow  "" breathes frank  and he is speaking as much for the audience as for himself . while these sorts of things are nothing new to the genre  rarely have they been done so well and with such enthusiasm . and there are a couple of particularly imaginative sequences  especially a visually awesome one at the movie's climax . the only real downside to "" frequency "" is that the serial killer storyline which dominates its second half is rather pedestrian . this is not to say that it's badly done -- it's intriguing enough in its own way -- but it just doesn't live up to the wonder which permeates the rest of the movie . scenes like one where frank is arrested for being the nightingale killer seem commonplace  for instance  and the proceedings generally feel as though they've been lifted out of an uncommonly bizarre episode of "" law and order "" . but even this is energised by excellent performances from caviezel and particularly quaid . "" frequency "" lives or dies on the conviction of their father/son relationship  made more challenging by the fact that their communications aren't face-to-face . but both actors are up to the task  bringing genuine emotion to the story . as a result  it's easy to suspend our disbelief and buy into the movie  and it's hard to suppress a cheer when frank survives the fire  or when father and son team up to stop the killer . director gregory hoblit does a good job  especially in keeping the frequent and potentially dull scenes of frank and john talking on the radio alive and interesting . also  he wisely chooses not to overplay the changes father and son have wrought on the present . although some differences are highlighted  many others are left as subtle background detail . like "" back to the future ""  this gives the film a richness it would otherwise be lacking . "" frequency "" has a broad appeal that's rare in movies today . it's a science-fiction movie where the characters come first  where visual effects take a backseat to story and acting  but which is exciting and suspenseful nonetheless . "" frequency "" probably won't win any academy awards  but it was one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences i've had in a long time . and  in the end  i can't ask for much more than that . copyright © 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery  http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/frequency . html -- _______________________________________________________________________ / shannon patrick sullivan | "" we are all in the gutter  but some of us \ | shannon@mun . ca | are looking at the stars .

"© copyright 2001 planet sick-boy . all rights reserved . with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there  and his latest  hearts in atlantis  is no different . its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile  which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . the parallels don't end there  either . atlantis was adapted by william goldman  who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . in fact  it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories  but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale  called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . it's set in 1960 harwich  connecticut  where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold  self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis  joe gould's secret )  who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . bobby spends his time with his two closest friends  john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem )  who become something like the kevin  paul and winnie of harwich . when a new tenant moves into the vacant room  the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins  hannibal )  a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday )  dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men  a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . i won't go into what these powers are  but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth  a la mile ) . atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter  titled heavenly shades of night are falling  and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married  middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars  which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski  the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . the acting is solid from everyone  including hopkins  who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem  who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . while i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay  i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . goldman  for those of you who don't read premiere  writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films  carefully explaining why they all suck  make no sense and insult their audiences  while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . it's mean-spirited but fun to read  mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson  o . j . and robert blake ) . in atlantis  which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby  one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . well  he's not  and it doesn't make sense . 1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements

"" the supernatural thriller  written and directed by alejandro amenábar ( "" open your eyes "" )  adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . the cinematography  by javier aguirresarobe  is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . overall  the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented  only to learn they are actually a child's toy  a military test subject or a department store dummy . watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter  i always wanted to shout  "" get on with it ! "" as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "" the others  "" my reaction was much the same . set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii  the story focuses on grace ( kidman )  who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband  charles ( christopher eccleston )  a missing serviceman . anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors  protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . at the beginning of the film  three servants  mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan )  young  mute lydia ( elaine cassidy )  and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes )  an aging gardener  join the family . the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first  but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . to make matters worse  the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home  only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . that's essentially the whole story  with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . earlier  there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside  only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . the visuals in the otherworldly sequence  courtesy of aguirresarobe  are simply astounding . i also enjoyed the presence of religion  a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . when mother is away  though  the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore  just as real children do . but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending .

"my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times )  two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins . this is exactly what happened in this movie  but fortunately  they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . this movie was exceptional for many reasons . one being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly  one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i'll let you fiqure which is which ) . also  they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) . experience counts for a lot ! !

"mute witness ( 1994 ) a film review by justin felix . copyright 1999 justin felix . any comments about this review ? contact me at justinfelix@yahoo . com all of my film reviews are archived at http : //us . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? justin + felix written and directed by anthony waller . starring marina zudina . special cameo by alec guinness . rated r ( contains brutal violence  nudity  and profanity ) 90 mins . synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist  working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow  witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians . meanwhile  the artist's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her . comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it . drawn by the clever artwork on the video box  i rented the film expecting a complete turkey . mute witness  however  was original  offbeat  and well-made . it's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about . i've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit  and it may be seen  on occasion  on the independent film channel . the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense  as billy  the quite believable mute heroine  sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film . the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures . to throw a curveball into the fray  billy's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes . a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film . look for alec guinness ( obi-wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper . definately check this movie out ; although  as a word of warning  it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren't for the squeamish .

"the director of the crow ( 1994 ) returns with this happy epic  set in a world where the sun is always shining and everyone is cheerful . only kidding . as you could guess by the title  dark city is a dark  depressive  but somewhat entertaining picture . set sometime in the future  the film begins when we see john murdoch ( sewell ) wake up with no memory . he can't remember his wife emma ( connely ) or the murders that he has been framed for . and when he encounters strange  tall people wearing silly hats trying to kill him ( called 'the strangers' )  he tries to get answers . with the help of dr . scheriber ( sutherland ) he tries to work out what the hell is going on . hot on his tail on this time is world weary cop inspector frank bumstead ( hurt . ) despite the dark setting  and the depressive mood the picture has  dark city is entertaining . the first thing that makes the film fun is the cast . director alex proyas has managed to assemble a pretty good cast for what is essentially a very silly sci-fi movie . rufus sewell does a good job looking confused  and also does the action scenes all right aswell . sutherland appears to be having fun as the doctor  even if he is overacting just a little . his delivery of his lines really started to annoy me  though . ( he pauses every two words . ) more worringly  he's looking more like his father every day . connelly fine in her role  although it dosen't require much . her singing voice  by the way  is anita kelsey  so don't expect any connelly hits in the chart's any time soon . william hurt is not bad  even though he dosen't really appear to be trying . also popping up is ian richardson and richard o'brian as two of the strangers . both are good english actors  and watching them dress up in the most stupid costumes  blurting out lines which a b movie screenwriter would be proud of is actually quite amusing ( if you're british  that is . ) then again  o'brien dressed up stupid in the rocky horror picture show ( 1975 ) so looking silly is no stranger to him . like the crow  the film is directed like a music video with a large budget . proyas uses fast cuts  quick zooms and a dance soundtrack to great effect  as they manage ( along with the acting ) to drown out the poor dialogue ( written by lem dobbs  david s . goyer and proyas himself . ) the fast paced directing helps the movie bound along . the dialogue just slows it down . it's clumsy  stupid  and in the end  just boring . the best thing about dark city  however  is the look of the film . the city is impressive  it's look the place the crow ( and deckard from bladerunner  1982 ) would live . the special effects are also impressive  especially the ones in the overblown finale . dark city is a definite case of style of content . if you get bored of the movie  just sit back and enjoy the great scenery  the great directing  and the soundtrack . this things alone probably make dark city worth watching . it may not be the best film of the year  but dark city is worth watching  and is ultimately just good fun .

"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail  i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online . and i wonder : is that so bad ? well  the commercial part is . as for the movie  well  as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan  i think i'll be okay . to paraphrase james berardinelli  whose reviews i admire very much  tom hanks and meg ryan can act . they are both wonderful  but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films  such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan  and his glorious triumph in philadelphia  i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious . tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? meg ryan  america's high school sweetheart  can act . she's had a handful of memorable performances  including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does  due to the  well  um  you get the idea  and if you don't  get the movie-- fantastic ) . but  i like her best when she's  well  perky . she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks  they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples  but i don't really know . all i know is that i just like them both . they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist  and i'm not going to even try . they're just really  really cute  sweet  and charming . hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron  who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . here  the setup is a little different . kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . she is successful  beautiful  and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . she is also having an affair  of sorts . you see  kathleen  with the handle shopgirl  is secretly emailing ny152 . they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics  and they have no idea who each other is . ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks )  a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores  run by his father ( coleman ) . fox books has decided to open a store on the west side  right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner ""  run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . every morning  these two email each other silly  and every day  they fight "" to the death ! ! "" . it's a charming premise  and one that works nicely  balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra  if you'll excuse my bluntness . this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . hmm . well  the movie goes through twists and turns  having some sad moments and happy ones  until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up ""  to use modern terminology  and kiss their way into happiness . you know it's going to happen  the question is now ? thankfully  ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey  kinnear  chappelle  and a host of others  including a great scene involving brothers  aunts  and two sweet kids . it's all cute and wonderful  and for all of the idealism  it makes me feel good . hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . he is  i believe  america's greatest actor . does he show it here ? nah . but he's still tom hanks  and she's still meg ryan . which is what this movie boils down to . it's pure confection . all the bits about the godfather  the jokes  the superb script  it's all really sweet . there are some immense flaws  like pacing . the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked  and for a romantic comedy  it's slow . once hanks knows the secret  it gets really slow . i even looked at my watch a couple times  to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for  so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . e-mail ? when my kids are my age  i don't know what we'll be using . but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody  and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . they just work together  and it's nice to see . it gives you  well  a smile . the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious  and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . i've always believed that movies are very powerful  very powerful indeed . you see  mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think  entertain  and procreate . movies can definitely do the first two  and as for the third  well  i'd rather not think about that . i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint  and that films that entertained you were good  because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan  which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment . tom hanks and meg ryan are magical  as is this movie . it's a sweet  lovely affair with a technology twist . it may be a long commercial  but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .

"apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash  backdraft  far & away )  most noted for his dramatic film making  displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone )  this film is his most successful effort yet . perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself )  kevin bacon ( footloose  tremors  a few good men etc . )  gary sinise ( forrest gump )  bill paxton ( aliens  true lies  boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss  just cause ) . . all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . jim lovell ( hanks )  the mission commander  together with his crew  fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission  more than three quarters way to the moon . suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . if they ever reach it . ed harris and gary sinise who play  respectively  the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles  both delve into their roles superbly . audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew  as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . also  there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well  thanks to film-music maestro james horner . watch out for the launching sequence  it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . this is however  just a minor point  just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . you should enjoy it .

"rated r for intense violence  sexuality and some nudity . starring : jamie lee curtis  donald pleasance  nancy loomis  p . j . soles . once in a great while a brilliant horror film will come out  this year we've had the new classic 'the blair witch project' which has been hailed as the scariest film ever made . while one of the scariest  halloween still reigns supreme as the most horrifying movie ever put on film strip . it's whole approach to horror movies are the most amazing thing of the film is that it needs no gore  no explicit violence and no excess blood to scare the hell out of us  instead it relies on genuine scares and atmosphere to make us pee our pants with fright . the score of the film is also a big thing too . sometimes the score is what scares us the most  along with michael myers we have no mercy from this terrifying motion picture masterpiece . the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director  he really is . he wrote this film  he directed this film  he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film . i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people . i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant  and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen . i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt  a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation  in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe . in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film . it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2  4  and 7 being truly good . it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan . since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30  000 copies  i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film . no words can describe the dvd . in 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 . now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield  illinois  followed by his past doctor sam loomis . the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut . why is he stalking her ? check out halloween ii it explains it all . on this unholy night on october 31  1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives  which is trying to stay alive . the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk . nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job  and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did . what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film  with scares  wit  and style . the movie is flawless if not perfect . no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one  and in my opinion never will . 'halloween' will be like 'psycho' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later . i just hope someday 'halloween' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition . 'halloween' isn't just another slice-and-dice horror flick  it's an intelligent  horrifying and best film experience ever made . see 'halloween' and be scared . . . . then watch it again ! reviewed by brandon herring october 7  1999 . ratings for the other halloween movies : halloween ii- ½ halloween iii- zero stars halloween 4 : the return of michael myers- * * * halloween 5 : the revenge of michael myers- * * halloween : the curse of michael myers- * * halloween : h20- * * * * brandon herring movie review heaven ( http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/movie/3160/moviereviewheaven . html

"capsule : the funniest horror movie ever made ; a melange of dario argento and wile e . coyote . evil dead 2 : dead by dawn is the result of an unstable fusion of warner bros . cartoon slapstick and _giallo_ horror-movie conventions . it's a flick with the mind of a splatter film and the heart of a mack sennett two-reeler . in plain  non-fanboy language  it's a ton of disgusting fun . example : a monster of the undead rises from the cellar  only to have its head smashed in the trapdoor . its eyeball pops out and flies into the mouth of one of the three screaming girls in the movie . gulp . the plot  what there is of it  is simple to the point of irrelevancy . a young man and his girlfriend head out to an abandoned cabin for a romantic interlude  and unwittingly unleash the evil undead . the girl dies horribly and the man ( square-jawed bruce campbell ) lives -- but as what ? horrendous mutations strike him like epileptic fits . the dead rise out of their graves and inflict ghastly punishments and tortures on him . his own hand rebels against him ( and the punishment he exacts on it is howlingly painful ) . the majority of the movie is one long  roaring blast of slime  guts  special effects and ear-drilling sound effects  but it's put together in a way that gets more than a fair amount of good laughs . evil dead 2 is most likely * the * item that started the whole trend of sly  self-referential horror movies ( culminating  of course  in the brilliantly nasty scream )  although it's a lot more freakish and far-out .

"starring : arthur hill ( dr . jeremy stone )  david wayne ( dr . charles dutton )  james olson ( dr . mark hall )  kate reid ( dr . ruth leavitt ) . produced and directed by robert wise . the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . i know that is very sweeping statement  so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction  "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film  but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . most all other films we normally classify as science fiction  or sf  are really just fantasy  action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . something bad happens to them . pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . apparently everyone in the town is dead . the authorities call a "" wildfire alert  "" summoning four scientists  all but one of them somewhat reluctant  to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . two of scientists  stone and hall  fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks  their blood turned to powder in their veins . some went insane before they died and two of them  a baby and an old wino  are miraculously still alive . they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab  where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712  "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda  an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . they barely call off the bombing in time . but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . this triggers the lab's last-ditch defense mechanism  an atomic bomb . to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days  the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . the performances are universally fine  with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained  just like scientists . to me  the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step  puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don't expect . this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating  mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body's wrist is slashed  spilling its powdered blood .

"lili taylor nabbed one of her first lead roles in this true life drama about valerie jean solanas  the woman who shot andy warhol in 1968 . but the film is more of a showcase to the ways of the 60s and the influence that warhol and other artists had on the people at that time . valerie jean solanas ( taylor ) is a lesbian feminist who as written a book called scum manifesto  a book ( which is now a classic ) about the way that men ( like disease  or so she says ) have been ruling here for the millions of years before us . she tries to sell it on the street  and is thrilled when her drag queen friend is invited to andy warhol's pad . this is her chance to sell him not only on the book  but on some plays that she has been writing . but andy is just like all of the other men out there . when a publisher signs her to a fraud contract and a friend puts her on a television show discussing homosexuality where the host makes fun of her  she begins to think that andy is all behind it . he's been constantly ignoring and making fun of her and she doesn't like it . her increasing rage is about to bring on the deadliest of consequences . lili taylor gives the performance of her career ( at least so far ) she puts every ounce that she can into this character and it's a great treat to watch . flaws are abound however  most of the film is boring and needs something interesting to be put on the screen and the story was told harsher than it needs to be . still  the film does a good job of examining the inner rage that overcame the woman and her actions thereafter . if your looking for a cool 60s noir piece  rent i shot andy warhol  which gets * * * stars . the young-uns : the main character is lesbian and we see one lesbian encounter . she is also a prostitute and we see two ( not very explicit ) sex scenes of her servicing her customers . it also contains strong language and drug use . good age : 16 & up a review by frankie paiva the 12 year-old movie reviewer e-mail me at swpstke@aol . com visit my website at : http : //expage . com/page/teenagemoviecritic

"i love japanese anime on the big screen . the gorgeous colors  the daunting cel animation detailing the smallest blades of grass  the complex storylines and character designs  and the thundering soundtrack . and the impending release of vampire hunter d : bloodlust has made me wet with anticipation . the original vampire hunter d was produced for video only in 1985 . its twisted violence  a plot thick with deception and honor  perverted sex scenes  and beautiful acts of heads and limbs being lopped off are a d&d geek's wet dream . based upon volume three of hideyuki kikuchi's vampire hunter d novel series  bloodlust follows the continuing story of d and his travels as a vampire hunter for hire . in the distant future  vampires rule with an iron first over fiefdoms of human-occupied lands with their minions of mutants and werewolves . as the years have passed  though  the vampire rulers have gradually lost their power and are now being hunted by bounty hunters . one of the most famous hunters is a mysterious outcast named d  a "" dunpeal "" ( born of a vampire father and a human mother )  who's equipped with a super-quick sword  a black cape blowing in the wind  and a penchant for ass kicking . d's latest job involves a simple rescue operation to reclaim an affluent family's lovely daughter charlotte from the clutches of meier link  an ultra-smooth vampire with a silly eurotrash accent . but competition waits in the form of the markus brothers -- a randy bunch of mercenaries who use knives  strength  crossbows  and even a guy's ghost to capture their vampire booty . along the way  the undead rise from their graves  werewolves howl at the moon  and creeping evil in the shadows crosses their paths at every turn . vampire hunter d : bloodlust is a qualified success in the animation department  combining fantasy with reality through the solid efforts of asian production house madhouse studios ( also responsible for co-creating the awesome hbo spawn animated series ) . but there's a strong western influence in both set design and landscapes throughout the picture . as well  director yoshiaki kawajiri ( wicked city ) handles the action well and delivers a number of memorable moments that even rival anime classics like battle angel . on the flip side  the main problems with the film are that its plot is weak and the characters fail to evolve . bloodlust never sells the conviction of evil within any of the main characters  instead relying on the age-old romanticism of the vampire . eventually it degenerates into a standard love story/rescue mission . worse still  d's character is so utterly invincible there's never a sense that the story could go any other way than that he will save the girl and beat the evil bad guys . the film's humor  mainly projected by d's talking left hand  feels forced and unsure . vampire hunter d : bloodlust earns enough points in the animation department to carry the innocuous plot . it's almost enough to make you forgive the lousy title .

"as fairy tales go  cinderella has to be one of the most famous . almost everyone knows it  well at least in north america . so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . it has been done before with varying results . this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . the basic story remains unchanged but  one thing that seems to vanish with this version  and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . . unlike in the fairy tale  the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . the prince'  who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france  meets 'cinderella'  known as danielle  on a few occasions  most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france  with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . this addition of leonardo da vinci  was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie  since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle  a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore  and that of the evil step mother  played by anjelica huston  are well developed and well played by the two women . although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . but  anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella  but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . all in all this movie takes you back into history  into a seemingly magical fairy land . but  don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality  it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not  and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing

"congratulations to kate winslet for defying the odds  by choosing to play the lead role in the small  but beautiful hideous kinky as a follow-up to her oscar nominated turn in titanic  the highest grossing and most expensive film of all time . but was this really such a surprise ? not at all  once you look at the wide range of films that the british actress appeared in before titanic . she showed incredible talent at a young age in such films as jude  heavenly creatures and sense and sensibility ( for which she recieved her first oscar nomination ) . her latest  hideous kinky  is an exotic odyssey that is much more than a star vehicle . hideous kinky is not a plot driven movie  but it tells the tale of a hippie named julia ( kate winslet ) who has brought her two young girls ( bella riza and carrie mullan ) to morocco to find peace  love  and faith in the early 70's . while in london  the children's father thrives as a poet  julia has no money . it is then that she meets bilal ( said taghmaoui )  a moroccan ex-con who is hiding from his past . he wins the affection of julia and her children and he becomes like a father to them . bilal seems to be a nice man  but he often vanishes at times when he is needed . for all the wonder of hideous kinky  the real pleasure comes from watching the two little girls onscreen . they both run around screaming wild phrases like "" hideous kinky ! "" and each character is a presence on her own . it is rare for children to dominate a film  especially when matched up against kate winslet  who gives one of her better performances . hideous kinky reminded me a little of this year's a walk on the moon  because both are similar tales of a woman trying to find herself during the same time period . hideous kinky's wondrous soundtrack combines moroccan music with 60's hits  and john de borman's luscious cinematography makes the film what it is . director gillies mackinnon ( regeneration  a simple twist of fate ) has crafted a spritual gem  scripted by brother billy . mackinnon lets kate winslet show depth unseen in titanic  and he shows a talent for working with young actors . as for the film's title ; it's a bit misleading  and i still haven't figured out what it means . but hideous kinky is an independent film that takes us to places we've never been . a review by akiva gottlieb  the teenage movie critic akiva@excite . com http : //www . angelfire . com/mo/film watch me on tbs' "" dinner and a movie "" may 21  8 : 05pm est get your free  private email at http : //mail . excite . com/

"men have feelings too . men cry  despite the stigma attached to their gender  or at least they want to more than they let on . it's all societal conditioning . that's the pretentious premise of this never-ending  two-hour look at couple dysfunction . with a highly acclaimed cast that includes anthony lapaglia  barbara hershey  and geoffrey rush you would hope this idea would provide great material for such illustrious actors to sink their teeth into . unfortunately  having been adapted for the screen from a play  by the playwright himself  much of the emotional impact is lost in overwhelmingly dramatic dialogue . valerie ( hershey )  married to john ( rush )  is a therapist  and her patients' lives are starting to intrude on her own mental state . her daughter was horribly murdered two years before and her marriage has been stagnant ever since . she and john love each other but cannot connect . one of valerie's patients  patrick  is a homosexual who continually talks of an affair with a married man . slowly  valerie becomes convinced that the divide between she and john is larger than she thought  possibly as a result of patrick . then there's leon ( lapaglia ) a cop married to the beautiful and vibrant sonja ( kerry armstrong )  who is secretly going to valerie for therapy . leon is having an affair with jane ( rachael blake )  though he is still in love with his wife  as an attempt to feel something . jane herself is consistently lonely after separating from her husband and often spies on the family next door . these circles become claustrophobic because valerie suddenly disappears one evening . leon is put on the case as a detective and breaks off his affair with jane  but still can't get his life in order . these factors combine to create many a scene in which men are trying to express emotions and mistakes to one another  and fail miserably . to give the film some credit  it is able to portray masculine anxiety in reacting to a situation too much like a stereotypical woman would . the real problem is that during sympathetic moments  emotive speeches seem forced on all the characters that are uttering them . while the acting is basically impeccable  the conversations are unreal and difficult to accept  even at their most dramatic climaxes . it doesn't help that  when these men are trying to talk to one another  there is repetitive whining about how men aren't suppose to cry or show emotion . still  what keeps things interesting is that every person involved is heavily flawed . they lie and cheat and find it difficult to learn from their mistakes . there's always hope  in a new scene filled with tension  that some kind of new barrier will be breached  that some catharsis will come through . the plot is hazy enough  as are its characters  that any growth or change is unpredictable . to see the little details that spring from the characters' effects on each other rings true enough . what also works are the dysfunctional marriage scenes between husband and wife . communication comes through looks and stares instead of accusatory speeches . the annoying chatter present when it's two movie-character men talking is thankfully left out . lantana's strengths and weaknesses  like its characters  balance each other out . not a flaw can be found in how it articulates difficulty within a marriage . if only it would stop complaining about how men are raised .

"based on the laura zigman novel  animal husbandry  someone like you is a romantic comedy about a late night tv talent coordinator named jane ( ashley judd )  whose luck in love is predictably bad . so predictable is her misfortune  in fact  that she has devised a pervasive theory on the subject  revolving around the notion that men are like cattle . when she meets her show's new executive  ray ( kinnear  you've got mail )  however  her luck -- she thinks -- begins to change . but ray  she discovers  is just a typical bull  looking to spread his seed in wider pastures . and it's not until he dumps her for his ex-girlfriend that she realizes the true depth of her plight . jane  it seems  is an old cow . and ray is looking for a new cow . this joke more or less carries the film  and -- though interesting at first -- it gets old after its twentieth or fiftieth appearance in the script . fortunately  though  the film's fresh  funny dialogue packs enough power to keep things interesting . and the wry  cynical performance of hugh jackman ( x-men ) as the incorrigibly good-timing eddie drops in just in time to prevent the entire film from degenerating into a ridiculously softball piece of fluff . these combine with quick  quirky editing to provide enough stimuli to keep most audiences alert for this sub two-hour picture . those needing a little more stimulation than that ( men  mostly ) should take heart in the fact that ashley's underpants scene from the movie's trailer is served justly on the big screen . ( though anyone looking for world-class cheerleading sequences will be saddened to learn that judd's jumping splits performance was ruined by her inability to keep both legs straight in midair . for the record  this didn't bother me a bit . ) judd carries her role with a meg ryan-esque charm that should prove valuable in future productions  while jackman proves he has all the qualities of a rugged  enviable leading man . the supporting cast is funny  and well placed  as well -- particularly ellen barkin as the host of the late night show . much to my surprise  someone like you made for a funny  enjoyable picture right up until its final moments  when it completely brained itself by falling into the usual rut of romantic comedy conclusions . with its richness of dialogue and editing  i was certain it might have overcome its genre to set some new precedent in romantic comedy cheese . but no . in the end  this is still a warm  fuzzy picture with enough wit to satisfy most audiences in need of a laugh . ladies : go for the humor . gents : stay for the underpants .

"i didn't read mitch albom's book  tuesdays with morrie  which spent about two jillion years on the bestseller lists . but based on the movie  i can see why so many people bought the book and why it's ripe for criticism . as brandeis university professor morrie schwartz's body deteriorated from lou gehrig's disease  former student albom decided to record the man's thoughts on an array of topics . if the movie is anything like the book  then morrie sounds like the world's foremost pop psychologist . and that's part of the problem i had watching the adaptation . albom claims that morrie was "" a force "" in the classroom  but he gets stuck saying things like "" once you learn how to die  you learn how to live . "" albom is certainly a happier person for having talked to his teacher  but i get the feeling he could have rented old yeller or watched a few self-help infomercials and came out ok . sarcastic comments aside  i can't fault a made-for-tv movie that has sturdy  sensitive performances and good intentions . if i can be taught about the values of life and not want to smack any of the characters upside the head  then the movie can't be all that bad . hank azaria ( the birdcage ) plays albom  a work-obsessed detroit sportswriter who is constantly on the go . his world stops when he sees a news special profiling morrie's condition . some 15 years after promising to keep in touch and not doing so  albom decides to visit his professor . pretty soon  they regularly meet on tuesdays--morrie's old office hours . jack lemmon plays morrie  a man whose indomitable spirit is still whole regardless of the medical obstacles he faces . it's a role that could have been played like a geriatric patch adams  but lemmon ( one of the best actors of his generation ) handles the role with grace . azaria  always an undervalued actor  does a good job and even sounds a bit like albom  a regular on espn . azaria has always had a slightly cynical streak to him that makes him more human . that trait serves him especially well in this occasionally sudsy  but overall entertaining fare .

"the thin red line ( m ) . ( twentieth century fox ) director : terrence malick stars : sean penn  nick nolte  jim caviezel  john cusack  elias koteas  woody harrelson  ben chaplin  jared leton  adrien brody  george clooney  john c reilly  john travolta  john savage  arie verveen  dash mihok running time : 171 minutes . writer/director terrence malick can hardly be called prolific . he made only two films ( the critically acclaimed badlands and days of heaven ) in the mid-'70's  before taking a self imposed twenty year hiatus from hollywood . his first film in two decades is one of the most eagerly anticipated cinema events this side of the new star wars film . while it is certainly visually impressive  malick's the thin red line is something of a disappointment  especially when compared with spielberg's achievement in the recent devastating and unforgettable saving private ryan . based on the novel by james jones  the thin red line deals with us forces fighting the japanese army at guadalcanal  a bitter and costly campaign that became one of the turning points of w . w . ii . however  malick's epic war film is a different animal to spielberg's . unlike spielberg  malick doesn't immediately hurtle us into the inferno of battle . instead  he lulls us into the brutality of war through an extended prologue . witt ( jim caviezel )  an awol soldier  lives in short-lived tranquillity in a peaceful native village somewhere in the pacific . he becomes part of the massive us landing force at guadalcanal . the film's centrepiece is the extended and savage campaign to destroy japanese machine gun fortifications and take a crucial hill . this often graphic and quite harrowing battle occupies over half of the film's three hour running time . however  the action lacks the intensity and ferocity of spielberg's recreation of the fury of warfare . it also seems to lack that gritty air of authenticity that seemed to effectively suck audiences into the maelstrom . the combat scenes give the audience the extremes of heroism . but malick is also concerned with showing the madness of battle fatigue  and the film depicts the senseless loss of life and futile carnage of the war . the thin red line is almost a profound and almost poetic meditation on the nature of war and how it poisons man's soul . there's nothing noble about this bloody conflict  and  ultimately  there are no winners . the film was shot on location  partly in tropical far north queensland as well as in the solomon islands . such is malick's reputation that he had a veritable who's who of hollywood queuing up for small roles  including john travolta  john cusack  woody harrelson  george clooney  and sean penn . unfortunately  though  few of the characters leave a lasting impact on the audience  and i found that i didn't really care about them or their fate . nick nolte is dynamic as the obsessed and driven colonel who relishes his first opportunity to fight a war after fifteen years in the army  and who doesn't care how many men have to lose their lives in securing a vital strategic position . caviezel brings a human face to the film as witt  the reluctant soldier who ultimately becomes a hero when tested in battle . the thin red line is certainly malick's most epic and ambitious film to date  and it is as meticulously crafted and evocative as his previous work . he gives this war film an almost elegiac quality and a rare humanity . his sweeping vision is complemented by the spectacularly gorgeous cinematography of dual oscar winner john toll and the haunting score from hans zimmer .

" i've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges  but i loved him in the big lebowski . the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind  and the fit is perfect . the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles  a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . he's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy  but not before they urinate on his rug . the dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski  a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . the millionaire refuses  but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task  and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers  millionaires  high schoolers  nihilists  artists  pornographers  thugs  and league bowlers . comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres  so take my recommendation as you will : for me  the big lebowski is very funny . it is an incredibly successful comedy  the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together  but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . all the characters end up as the butt of jokes  but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . each person may be a comic caricature  but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . the characters are firmly established  and they never change their behavior for a quick  cheap laugh . it's not what they do that's funny  it's who they are  which is why the acting is so important  and so successful  in this movie . worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus  not hay-soos )  the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling  long-winded narrator . aside from the performances  what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . people lose trains of thought  they interrupt  they boast  they repeat themselves  they repeat their friends . . . they sound natural . taken with fargo  the coen brothers' last film  it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . ethan coen is not just good at directing actors  he's also good at technical directing . he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . perhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists  carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed  as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . all around  the big lebowski is great  solid comedy . outstanding acting  writing  direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/

"" he meets the show's other characters  which include jesse ( joan cusack )  his cowgirl sidekick  the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer )  and bullseye  his trusty horse . they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival  as once their set is completed  they will be sold to a japanese toy museum  and finally escape storage forever . this means woody now faces a difficult choice . with his friends coming to rescue him  does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy  or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? as in the original film  "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation  and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . reportedly  the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release  but after seeing the improvements that had been made  disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . the film is well worth seeing on the big screen . the colors are bright  the textures sharp  and even the human characters look more "" human . "" the animation is consistently seamless  with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here  but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn  the store owned by woody's captor . pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done  with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . the voice work is also perfectly complementary  and as with the first movie  does much to help further character development . tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz  making you forget who is doing the voice . it was woody and buzz up there  not tom and tim . all the cast members from the original reprise their roles  and each is excellent . several new voices have been added  with joan cusack  kelsey grammer  and wayne knight doing fine work . "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization  and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . woody faces difficult choices  while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy  forcing him to see what he used to be like . the new characters are also developed quite well  especially jesse  who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved  then forgotten by her owner . it may be computer-animated  and it may have sappy music  but it's downright touching . the script  despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers  is endlessly clever and inventive  especially considering that it's a sequel . the reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . not this one . we get character change  new characters  and new issues brought up . "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . the humor is sharp and witty  with something to amuse both kids and adults . there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park  "" among others  new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots  and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug's life "" and the 1997 short "" geri 's game . "" ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . ) the action is fast and furious  and the chases ( in the street  in a toy store  in an elevator  on a baggage carousel  and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . "" toy story 2 "" never grows stagnant  because there is always something new to hold your interest . the more you pay attention to it  the more rewarding it is . it's rare to see a film like "" toy story 2 "" come along  because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike . it's created purely to entertain  and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person  it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "" toy story 2 .

of course  when something goes wrong in their new line of duty  the fbi looks for someone to blame for the foul-up  and even though it wasn't their fault  mulder and scully were there  and they're first in line to have the whole thing put on their heads . now they're going to try to clear their names  and along the way  they're going to learn a lot more about the mysterious conspiracy that's being run behind the scenes worldwide  to hide the real truth about just the kinds of things that mulder and scully used to investigate in the x-files division . of course  they can't learn everything - there's plenty more episodes of the series to be had  and future movies to be made . the performances are all acted by people who've handled these roles for years on the tv show ( with the exception of martin landau playing a new character - and he's never bad  so of course that's just another good point ) . and since they've had to time to develop the roles  they make us feel like we're watching developed  layered characters even if we don't watch the show much  or at all . we really care about mulder and scully - they actually have deep personalities  which is truly something to be appreciated  especially in today's film world . the action scenes are infrequent  but tense  and solid . really though  this story is driven by plot and dialogue . it's a winding plot that you have to pay attention to  especially if you're not a series afficianado  but trust me  it's worth it . some of the scenes are awe-inspiring  and the scope of some visuals  particularly towards the end  make you truly appreciate that this was made into a movie as opposed to just another episode of the show . the plot winds around and around but always holds your interest  thanks in part to great performances and in part to great writing that takes the time to give us characterizations of the people we're watching instead of just putting them through the paces . the effects  when they show up  are also great . seems like this movie works even for those who don't watch the show  and i also find it very hard to believe that those who do watch would be let down by this . if there's a flaw to this  it's that the villians aren't quite clearly explained enough . we understand their motives  but how did they come to reach these motives ? there had to be some kind of communication that we didn't learn about . i know  i know  i'm keeping this pretty vague . but i can assure you  i'm not digging too deep here  this is actually a question you need to ask yourself  and in the end  it's never quite answered . maybe series fans know more on this subject . though really  in such an otherwise great movie  why should i gripe about this ? i can't elaborate too much on things that were great because i wouldn't dare reveal the plot . you have to go and see it for yourself . and you'd better . the summer has had some letdowns  and some fun  but so far  this is the best ride out there  and it's a damn good ride that could hold its own in any summer . . . or any season of any year  for that matter . one wonders if chris carter  the show's creator  can continue to make x-files films that can stand alone as their own series and still make them interesting and relevant to the viewers at home . but there's no need to worry about this now . now  all you have to do is go see the

"director :   warren beatty cast :   warren beatty  sean astin  halle berry  don cheadle  laurie metcalf  oliver platt  paul sorvino  jack warden screenplay :   warren beatty  jeremy pikser producers :   warren beatty  pieter jan brugge  lauren shuler-donner runtime :   us distribution :   20th century fox rated r :   language  violence  drug use by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) when bulworth ended  i allowed myself a sigh of relief :   it is possible for me to enjoy political satire .   there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog  for instance  i found to be an intelligent but heartless film  while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness .   bulworth is a far better film than these  both in its execution and lasting impression .   it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture  but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character  and  in turn  we like him and actually care about the story .   beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again .   he hasn't slept in days  nor has he eaten  and  almost instantaneously  he goes insane .   he's not stark raving mad ( not outright  anyway )  but he's definitely bonkers .   it's the final weekend of his campaign  and his assistant  murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto .   bulworth begins the speech  but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest .   "" you mean  "" one lady asks  "" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? ""   "" well  "" he shouts  laughing  "" isn't that obvious ? "" the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman .   bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated .   suddenly  in the short span of this weekend  bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation  and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent .   his script and direction are both extremely sharp  as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself .   here is a man who's reached his limit  and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure .   i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations  but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) .   some of the segments are simply hilarious  such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him .   much of the film is completely absurd  but that's the fun part about it .   it's an angry  serious film at the core  but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre .   what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale .   beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny  but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .   beatty is so good that bulworth  despite his shortcomings as a human being  is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . the supporting cast is vast and colorful .   berry is luminous  as always  and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles .   don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work .   oliver platt is an actor who should be careful  for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) .   paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . is bulworth offensive ?   i suppose some may see it that way .   i wasn't offended by the film  but then again  i hardly care about politics .   i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story .   the film isn't perfect  of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me  and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) .   but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film .   bulworth is a smart  uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface .

"somewhere between big-budget action films and small-budget morality tales exists judgement night  a constantly exciting  always tense urban thriller about kids on the run . and no matter how you feel about foot-chase movies  or shoot-out movies ( or even movies that seldom show you the light of day )  * this * movie is never less than engaging at any time . we first meet frank wyatt  a family man whose wife thinks he should stop hanging out with the guys who "" have the hormones of teenagers "" and start being around adults more . but frank hasn't been out of the house in a long while and he thinks he needs a breather . so  he tells his wife he loves her  kisses his baby's head ( just like any devoted father and husband should )  and is off with his best friends for a night out . next  are mike  ray  and frank's brother ( whom he never  ever gets along with ) john . they all congregate in a van/bus  and are off to watch boxing in downtown chicago . wouldn't you know  traffic's too damn slow  and ray decides to get off the main highway for a short detour . and wouldn't you know  they find themselves in a part of town none of them has ever seen before . ray is determined to get them to the boxing match on time  but then a funny thing happens-- he hits some guy on the run from bad guys . the guys try to help out this stranger they've nearly killed  but before you know it the bad guys show up and retrieve the strange man . enter fallon ( played by denis leary )  a drug kingpin/mobster/whatever who pulls a gun and murders the man in cold blood . "" rule number one : do not steal from me  "" fallon states to his band of henchmen . "" rule number two  no witnesses . "" and so it goes  as this action-adventure is set into nonstop motion . given the amount of time this film in on the screen  and the number of long encounters which take place  not much time is allowed for much character development . so  there isn't any ( except if you count a whiner/wimp who only shows his true colors when it's too late ) . then again  developing characters who provide the grounds for a story that just about leaves you breathless  and nothing more  would be a waste of time  especially when the action is as good as it is here . we get fights in the sewers  on and off trains  in low-rent apartment buildings  and even ( the finale ) in a small shopping mall downtown . and each sequence has a distinct feel to it  and each is inventive enough to make you feel as though you haven't seen any of this before . the script  by lewis colick  is extremely derivative in its ways of executing action and suspense  and the score  by alan silvestri  ( when it can be heard through all the fantastic rap music ) sets a nice tone for what you see . director stephen hopkins  of predator ii fame  does what he couldn't do in that film with this one : make it credible enough for us to want to continue watching . true  this isn't a classical piece of cinema  but it does just what it needs to : stay on the screen as long as it needs to be there ( no longer  and no less )  and excite us while we watch .

"it must be tough to be a mob boss . just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro )  a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . i can believe it  too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick  baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with . suffering from reoccurring panic attacks  paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . and who better than billy crystal . after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops  father's day and my giant  crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . playing vitti's private shrink  the two very different stars strike an unorthodox  but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke  i think . placed in this mobster's shoes  deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather  part ii and casino . it's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so . the man behind the camera is harold ramis  whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star )  and his best directing effort  the bill murray vehicle  groundhog day . ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny  and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) . playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends  kudrow is amusing  but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped . the supporting cast sparkles . joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly  vitti's pea brained right-hand man  and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure' . the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout  putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides . the situation is just too cute to resist . it's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand . but hey  if you're in the mafia  using obscenities probably comes naturally . and near the end  seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat .

""" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" okay  there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning  skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . father  mother  and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins  and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . it's amazing  the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . before you know it  an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close )  a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . against the wishes of her mate and family leader  kerchak ( lance henricksen )  she takes on the infant boy as her own . tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father  "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . all he's looking for is acceptance  perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers  but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . when you really think about it  this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend . growing up  tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child  and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell )  and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . just fill in the blanks ! can you see it ? "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief  but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . we've already had a fish and a crab  and we've had a candle and a teapot  a genie and a dog  a few stone statues . . . . have we had an ape and an elephant yet ? well  there we go ! "" of course  there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line  so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed )  jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately  and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan  me jane "" scene . thankfully  those aren't the exact words . however  i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . how does he tell his name to another ape ? "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" well  regardless of my picky nature  the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived  but for some reason rather believable . but hey  tarzan's a young adult . do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? isn't that illegal in most countries ? oh  well . i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore . tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . there's lots of music to be sure  but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . we instead get more of a phil collins concert  as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . this isn't really a bad thing  as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different . do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system  because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . with each new feature  disney animation gets even better . not necessarily by leaps and bounds  but since they put out a new film each year  a steady rate of improvement is apparent  and this definitely shows in tarzan . there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect  and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers  and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan  it's "" extreme tarzan . "" however  tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene  "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort  utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . lasting but a few seconds at most  it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast  in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . as usual  the voice talent is up to snuff  convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . the one poor choice in casting  however  was rosie o'donnell . going into the film  i didn't know she was even a part of it  but when terk started talking  i recognized her voice immediately . her performance was fine  but through the rest of the film i kept thinking  "" that's no boy ape  that rosie o'donnell . "" distracting to say the least . i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story "" tarzan of the apes  "" so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book . but unless you're a purist  you should have few objections to this film . with solid performances  action  adventure  a bit of romance  and great music and animation  tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago  i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . this time  i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry  and tarzan was on the cup . 'nuff said .

"in 1912  a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world  and she was . she was also build to be one of the most luxurious  and that she was . finally  she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew  were part of the upper class and had the money to spare  or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . jack dawson makes the trip  and happens to be at the right place at the right time . rose dewitt bukater  a first class passenger  climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue  and a tale of death and tragedy . . . this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago  an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . the movie titanic shows what happened  maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy  but it still shows it very realisticaly . now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . it serves as both admirably  brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is  but that alone is not enough . the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting  with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting  and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie . the casting for the movie could really have been better  in my humble opinion that is . one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . yes  you read correctly  the ship is a character . how is the titanic a character ? you ask well simple  a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . now  to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there  you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . the movie will leave you amazed at the effects  and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie  just humans and an oversized ship . the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions  the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies  now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch  i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . the historical value of this movie is quite high  and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy  for it is extremely well done . the method of telling the story is also good  maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! it might not be the best movie in the world . . but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .

"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity . the film was directed by randal kleiser  who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon . but thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script  getting it right is a pleasantly quiet  moving  and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated  adult audience . getting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin  a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin . gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon  but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess . much to gavin's surprise  the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave )  a rich  married  and lonely 45-year-old . getting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is  to find the right woman to fulfill his life . getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development . gavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity . birdsall's superb  understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life . despite her limited screen time  redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer . for a supporting character  joan is unusually and impressively complex  thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance . gavin is also pursued  or perhaps plagued  by minnie  the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . after minnie and gavin meet at a party  she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role  and sir john gielgud  with his tongue in his cheek  embodies the height of arrogance as her father . gavin's eventual love-interest is jenny  the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . peter cook  the great british satirist  appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer . the scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat . gavin's over-protective mother ( pat heywood )  whom even woody allen would find overbearing  almost steals the movie . her life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals  such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . gavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . getting it right  for the most part  is very well-crafted  except for two minor shortcomings . first  the movie is about 15 minutes too long  and consequently it loses momentum at times . second  the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend  harry  and his unfaithful lover  winthrop . overall  however  getting it right is quite memorable for its humor  depth  sophistication  and outstanding acting . director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth  maturation  and self-discovery .

"written by stephen peters . directed by john mcnaughton . starring kevin bacon  matt dillon  neve campbell  denise richards  bill murray  robert wagner . rated r ( contains nudity  profanity  and violence ) 116 mins . synopsis : a wild teen-aged girl with an iq around 200 manipulates a beefy guidance counselor  a determined police detective  two trial lawyers  the u . s . judicial system  the news media  a millionaire playgirl  and her supersexy teen-aged daughter in an elaborate scheme to swindle millions of dollars . comments : for this week  i have decided to review a movie currently playing in theaters rather than an almost forgotten video collecting dust in the far corner of a rental outlet . this may become a trend as species 2  a sequel to one of the best bad sci-fi films of the decade  is set to be released this friday ( april 10  1998 ) . anyway  this week's turkey is the sleazy  exploitative wild things  a film which shares quite a number of conventions with many of the b-level  direct-to-video-or-cable thrillers i have reviewed in the past . the movie  in fact  only possesses one noticeable difference : it has an all-star cast . let's be blunt for a moment . veteran film actors kevin bacon and matt dillon are technically the main stars here ; they are listed first in the credits and the majority of the film's running time favors them . wild things' producers  however  heavily advertised this movie as an erotic exercise between rising stars neve campbell and denise richards . the movie posters prominently feature the two rising out of a pool of water and staring at the viewer with sultry gazes . i suspect the target audience for this film was predominantly younger males ; though  surprisingly  the matinee showing i attended with my friend had an audience with far more women than men . if one's only reason to see wild things is to see ms . campbell and ms . richards get it on  then one will be remarkedly disappointed . a menage a trois does occur between the two ladies and matt dillon  but it is a poorly-lit  seemingly superfluous scene . the two also kiss a couple of times  but it feels mechanic and obligatory rather than racy as it was intended . neve campbell  by the way  does not strip naked at all . sorry  guys . wild things' advertised sexual fireworks fizzle here  but the movie itself  as bad movies go  is quite entertaining . the actors turn in hammy performances ( more on this in a bit )  and the surprisingly complex script keeps the viewer guessing while the laughable dialogue is full of cheesy lines undercutting the seriousness of the subject matter . my friend and i chuckled throughout the movie  but the rest of the audience didn't seem to be in on it . don't go see wild things expecting a run-of-the-mill suspense film . ( it's an amusing exercise in sleaze populated with comically self-absorbed  greedy characters who all get what they deserve in the end . ) part of the film's qualified success comes from its cast . a number of fine  first-rate actors have fun with their characters . the attractive  young actress denise richards  of last year's megabudget starship troopers  nearly steals the show here as the pouty high-school student with a supermodel body who catches everyone's eyes . neve campbell  the scream queen of scream and scream 2  drops her innocent  damsel-in-distress routine and turns 180 degrees in her role as the trailer trash girl who secretly instigates everything . the best supporting nods go to bill murray and robert wagner  both making surprise appearances in this  an atypical film for either of them . bill murray  in particular  is great as the fraud-obsessed lawyer who can sniff a lawsuit from a mile away . robert wagner is hilarious in his wooden portrayal of another lawyer . he seems to be doing a self-parody of himself which reminds me of his brief role in the john candy vehicle delirious . despite its humorous dialogue and delightfully smarmy actors  wild things cannot be excused for some of its shortcomings . while the first two-thirds of the movie moves at a breakneck pace  the last third becomes tired . without revealing too much  one character will kill another only to be killed by someone else . it becomes a cycle which tries the audience's patience . also  though this film is designed to be unexpectedly funny  a subplot deals with an affair that a guidance counselor has with two of his students . this seems inexcusably unethical and borders on pedophilia ( the students  to give wild things the benefit of the doubt  may be 18 ) . the audience should feel uneasy when they realize they are viewing what is supposed to be a sexual affair between a high school teacher and his students . wild things ends on a somewhat unique note . important background flashbacks are interspersed throughout the closing credits  and they are rather fun to watch . so  don't get up and walk out the theater as soon as you see the closing credits start to roll at the end . all in all  wild things is a pretty good and humorous turkey . it's certainly not for everyone  but for those who are into exploitative thrillers like basic instinct or sliver  you could find a lot worse than this .

"directed by milos forman . written by peter shaffer ( based on his play ) . running time : 158 minutes . rated pg ( for language and sexual references ) . amadeus is considered one of the best films of the 1980s . that decade mostly developed brat pack films so there's no doubt that the epic film would be one of the best . it made the american film institute's top 100 list in the summer of 1998 . although it is not as good as some of the films near the bottom or off the list it still deserves it's place in cinema . antonio salieri ( f . murray abraham ) is a struggling composer who has worked hard to become great . throughout his childhood he has seen a little boy named wolfgang amadeus mozart . the young boy performed for royalty . when mozart grows up he is a giddy  over excited brat ( played now by tom hulce ) who makes obscene comments to women and curses . salieri can't understand why god has chosen such a delinquent to pass his music through . salieri swears hatred on mozart and the god who raised him to his status . the highlight of this movie is  of course  the music . john strauss did much of it but also included music by mozart  salieri  and giovanni battista pergolesi . the music is used beautifully in the many operas that take place during the movie . hulce and abraham do a great job acting during their many scenes of conducting and piano playing . abraham and hulce each were awarded academy award recognition which they deserve . abraham won best actor over hulce  which isn't wrong because two people can't win . abraham plays salieri with all the hatred he can without becoming an evil character . he has no heart and just wants the life that he thinks was taken from him as a brilliant composer . hulce does an excellent job as well as the eccentric mozart . he is able to act extremely serious during his compositions but then chase a woman around a house . this was easily his best role to date . he is very well cast with his young looking face and acting talent . director milos forman along with cinematographer miroslav ondrícek and the art and production designers have created one beautiful movie . the opera theater scenes  along with wonderful wigs  costumes  and makeup  are a delight to watch . the use of scope is also very good . now to why i believe amadeus to be less a film then the afi makes it to be . while i do really like many things about this movie i still have some complaints . the movie is quite long at 158 minutes . the movie isn't boring and is much shorter than other epics but it is still quite a long time . a couple of scenes could have been shortened and not have hurt the movie much . with my complaint aside  i can still say that amadeus was definitely one of the better movies to come out in the 80s . i don't know if it's one of 100 best of all time but it is a very good movie .

""" everybody has a story about chet baker . he was bad  trouble  and beautiful . "" let's get lost  bruce weber's visually thematic biography of '50s jazz musician chet baker  might well be the ultimate story  an evocatively photographed  seamlessly edited collage of sights and sounds . unfortunately  many people are going to pass up the film for two reasons : one  it's a documentary -- and two  it's in black and white . but those two elements alone combine to make let's get lost more compelling than most of this summer's run-of-the-mill movie fodder . the life and times of this jazz trumpeter and vocalist  whose troubled career culminated in a fall to his death from an amsterdam hotel window in may of 1988  is chronicled through a variety of cinematic techniques . candid interviews with an ensemble of friends  relatives  and fellow musicians  stills  archive footage of baker himself  in concert and out  moody  mesmerizing  iconoclastic . baker's whisper-like vocals permeate the background like cigarette smoke  ever present  softly punctuating the blank spaces . it's a near perfect blend of styles  yet it is never showy or pushy . in his 20s  baker was the james dean of the jazz world  his boyish good looks as much a part of his image as his hypnotic trumpet playing and soulful  lyrical style . working initially with the likes of charlie parker and gerry mulligan  baker quickly branched out on his own . soon his angular face was gracing record jackets everywhere . he even appeared in a number of movie bit parts  such as 1955's hell's horizon ( billed as "" chet baker and his trumpet "" )  as well as a number of disposable  italian teen-flicks . almost forty years later  the change is dramatic . baker's once adonis-like looks are wizened -- wrinkled creases of skin abound ; aged  hollowed out eyes ; bloodless cheeks ; a leather-faced  lipless junkie . baker knew more than anyone that you gotta pay the price if you wanna play the blues . baker's midas touch on stage became leprous in his private life . a compulsive womanizer  he left a legacy of cast-off wives and embittered offspring in his wake . there is a lot of hate in this movie ; few people have much respect for this burned out  unlikable shell of a man . even his mother  when asked if chet was a good son  cannot answer in the affirmative . what's so compelling about the film is that  as unappealing as baker is  his music is anything but . the only time that we feel he's being totally honest with us is when he's performing . then  and only then  do we feel the man's sincerity  his quietly hushed and sexy vocal style totally absorbing the viewer . the allure of his stage persona compared to the shambles of his personal life is staggering . in one scene  baker recalls the names of other jazz greats who have succumbed to the lure of drugs . the list seems endless . but this is not an anti-drug movie . it's a film about contrasts  about the profound affect one man had on the lives of others . director weber has gotten to the crux of the issue so adeptly that at times it's hard to believe that a lot of this film was shot before baker's death . at cannes  nearing the film's end  baker comments to weber that this is the first time he has ever faced such a rowdy audience . "" at those other places you could hear a pin drop  "" he observes . so when he calls for silence before performing his final  haunting number  "" almost blue  "" you probably could hear a pin drop . that silence  and the performance which follows  is a fitting elegy to a genius who lived hard yet made it all look so easy . | directed by : bruce weber david n . butterworth - university of pa | | rating ( l . maltin ) :  internet : butterworth@a1 . mscf . upenn . edu |

"by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking  moving  and completely unsentimental . i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant  which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . city of angels is a wonderful film  enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story  and avoids most of the cliches we're so used to seeing in films like this . city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders' 1988 film wings of desire . i have yet to see wings of desire  so i am  unfortunately  unable to make a comparison of the two . i have heard  however  that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways  which makes me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of its source material . nicolas cage stars as seth  an angel who  like all of his angel counterparts  is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . one day  he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan )  and his attention is called to her . the angels can make themselves seen to humans  but they can't experience any of the senses ( most importantly  touch ) . he shows himself to maggie  and she falls for him  unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . seth wants to become human so he can feel her . that's when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz )  "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . "" ( as a side note  i found messinger to be the most fascinating character  for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know  it sounds ridiculous  but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation  she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . this  of course  is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall  he is human  and happy to feel what it's like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . since i love this film so much  i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect . although it is original and mesmerizing  it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent  and steel has done a great job with them ) . the ending  too  could have been more powerful and less predictable . these elements are minor  though  and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . the acting is superb from everyone involved . this is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . he's quiet and pensive  and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . he's perfect for a role like this  and at the same time he reassures us he's not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it  as he shows in face/off ) . meg ryan is a powerful  enticing  and appealingly-chirpy actress  and her work here is some of her best . dennis franz  however  steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . director brad silberling is a talented man  and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters  rather than forced sentimentality . his direction is steady  and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning  maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . this is the way stories should be told  and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i've seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . the music  by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient )  is perfect for this film : it's quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! )  and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . it's a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously .

"1997  r  95 minutes [1 hour  35 minutes]starring : dustin hoffman ( stanley motss )  robert de niro ( conrad brean )  anne heche ( winifred ames )  denis leary ( fad king )  written by hilary henkin  david mamet ; produced by robert de niro  barry levinson  jane rosenthal ; directed by barry levinson ; based on the novel "" american hero "" by larry beinhart . satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything  including the jokes  is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . "" dr . strangelove "" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . "" men in black "" ) . what's unique about "" wag the dog "" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions  and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedy based on an original  smart premise  even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness . in this age of information and technology  we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things  it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news  but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas  and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics  the media coverage of politics  and the entertainment industry are so closely related  couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro )  a professional washington spin doctor  comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . brean  along with the president's top advisor  winifred ames ( heche )  fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . they pitch him an idea to "" produce "" the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it ) . soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play . we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation  such as a folk singer  visual and sound effects technicians  and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv  in the movies  or in the news . the characters' dialogue is witty and funny  although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . for example  one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry  but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . since it's all computer-enhanced anyway  she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . but then there's the gags and one-liners that  although are humorous  seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name  or  whenever a problem emerges  always responding with  "" this is nothing ! "" by the time the film makes it to the midpoint  everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . the first act is quickly paced  while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with  and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . however  it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . what had started off as a brilliant  somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . still  the situation comedy is quite funny  especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time  but think about afterwards and "" wag the dog "" at least succeeds in this respect . however  in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done  namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . then again  it's a valiant effort . please visit chad'z movie page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 180 new and old films reviewed in depth  not just blind ratings and quick capsules . also  check out the first shay astar web page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz/shayastar . html

"the age of innocence a film by martin scorsese starring : daniel day-lewis  winona ryder  and michelle pfeiffer written by jay cocks and martin scorsese based on the novel by edith wharton martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker  the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's  but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder  and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder )  a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker  who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families  in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may  countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer )  cousin of may  walks into archer's life . archer is immediately captivated  and finds himself in love with ellen . archer is also bound by the limits of new york society  which is an intrusive as any other in the world . archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska  attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese  but the theme is definitely not . it is a theme of forbidden romance  guilty pleasures  and the consequences causes because of those actions . there is a painstakingly flawed hero  and his choice between the life he wants  and the life he is destined for . in truth  it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about  but wants to find out more  much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . the performances are absolutely breathtaking . day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska  a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . ryder is probably the gem of the group  for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot  and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . the supporting cast is also wonderful  with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . his script is also excellent  slow in buildup  with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese  however  does it beautifully . the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . he is patient  but he films everything and anything remotely important . the cameras sweep  pan  track  and do more than they've ever done  but they are so subtle  one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot  but the viewer doesn't notice it  because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding  and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . not a fast film like goodfellas  this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . and like kundun  this is a slow-starting film that truly shines  when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year .

"saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . starring tom hanks  edward burns  tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made  ' saving private ryan is an harrowing  saddening and riveting movie . it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion  but it's certainly one of the best war movies made  and one of the best of 1998 . tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . action  drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . i'm not the war movie genre biggest fan  but i found this film to be gripping  and very scary  thanks to the excellent cast  direction and terrifying battle scenes . tom hanks is superb  straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles  such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . this time  he plays the role with gritty realism  and is much better for it . occasionally he overacts the sentimentally  but he generally delivers a fine performance . edward burns  looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck  also delivers a top notch performance  moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact  but is still watchable  and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . spielberg directs very well  putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . and what battle scenes they are ! they're truly terrifying  yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera  and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . the gore and violence isn't spared either  which body parts flying  and blood spurting . this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making . the cinematography is excellent  and the music score by john william's is also superb . it is never intrusive  and adds to the drama on-screen . but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan  there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . it is unusually flat  with many of the speeches strangely weak . the film never really makes any profound statements . this is not a major gripe  as private ryan is a film of action  not words . still  the script could of been a lot better . thankfully  the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . saving private ryan  in the end  is an excellent film  but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting . this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it  as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile . it really shouldn't be missed  and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie .

"first  i'd like to say it's nice to have spike lee vindicate himself after doing something like girl 6 . get on the bus is easily the best film he has made since do the right thing with the exception of maybe malcolm x . spike does in this film what he does best--he presents issues that face society in an unbiased manner and lets the audience sort their feelings on their own . i love a film that engages my mind . the story is about a busload of black men that board in south central los angeles and drive across the country to the million man march in washington d . c . the film was funded by fifteen african-american men and shot in just 18 days . this is another example of expert filmmaking ( writing  directing  acting ) that i hope the oscars do not overlook . the screenwriter  reggie rock bythewood is very talented . however  i would say that the screenplay is a little weak in a few spots . this may be due to the film's hurried production . but i tell you that nothing in the script is so bad as to detract from the better scenes . the greatest aspect of the screenplay is that the ideas behind the million man march and the reasons for going are expressed without directly involving the march itself . this makes those ideas much more powerful because it eliminates the inclusion of minister farrakhan  to which many would disregard the march's message in favor of claiming it racist and sexist . this idea is also expressed in another way . there is a member of the nation of islam on the bus who never says a word and never gets involved in any of the scenes . his presence is a symbol of the march  in that  even though the nation of islam was there and organized the march  the march was not about the nation of islam . spike lee is one of the best filmmakers working today . in get on the bus  he's trying something different--the sure sign of a filmmaker that understands that the learning process never stops . here  he meshes his ever-evolving style with that of a documentarian's eye . the bus ride feels "" captured "" by the filmmaker . although there is plenty of hand-held camerawork  it is as though spike lee was able to film a documentary and still maintain effective use of dollies  cranes and tripods . it is an astonishing feat from a filmmaker's perspective and an effective technique for anyone watching . as i watched the film  i noticed two things about the audience . the first was that anytime a character made a slant toward one of the homosexual characters  the audience laughed hysterically . the scenes were obviously written to be funny  but i think that the predictability of our own stereotypes was what the screenwriter was knowingly commenting on . i back this up with another scene where the bus stops at a roadside diner in tennessee . the instant we see all the white faces inside  the audience expects a confrontation . in fact  everyone gets along pretty well . even when ossie davis explains that steer wrestling was invented by a black cowboy  his listener responds with  "" how about that . "" it's fairly obvious that these two scenes say more about the audience than the characters . but then  that's what i expect from a spike lee joint .

"with storytelling this compelling  who needs books ? based on the book by author james ellroy  l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years . together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle  the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film  resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight  an atom would have to squeeze itself through . set in the 50s  the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities . jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style  concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention . there is also the young hot-shot rookie  ed exley ( pearce )  fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father . the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe )  a cop who believes in justice  the swift and violent way . 3 policemen  distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil . when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation  bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder . even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case  happenings began to link itself to the murder . the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood . the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects . in l . a . confidential  you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it . there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all . surprisingly  though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes  the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns'  pearce and crowe . pearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance . crowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental  he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here . superb acting .  wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever . easily the best hollywood piece for 1997 .

" cast : tommy lee jones ( agent kay )  will smith ( james edwards/agent jay )  linda fiorentino ( dr . laurel weaver/agent elle )  vincent d'onofrio ( edgar )  rip torn ( zed ) director : barry sonnenfeld certification : pg-13 ( usa ) mild violence and language year of production : 1997 men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction  action  and comedy that hits the target in every possible way . although another alien movie  men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn't  and towers above many other movies of its type . the brilliant acting  especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay  is also as good as it gets . director barry sonnenfeld  who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty  has crafted a masterpiece . the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be . the men in black  or mib  are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist . the mib are responsible for "" saving the world from the scum of the universe "" . a though job  indeed . the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states . presumably  these "" aliens "" are all migrant workers . that is  until the mib show up and begin interrogating them . agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien  but a real extra-terrestrial alien . when the alien makes a run for it  agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib's very unique weapons  and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence  agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them . the device  described as "" out of state ""  eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on . from here  we are introduced to james edwards  played very well by will smith . edwards  a police officer  is chasing a fleeing criminal . the criminal gives a very good chase  and at one point when edwards confronts him  the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground . edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building  where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go  because someone is after him . edwards doesn't take this seriously  but when the criminal shows very non-human characteristics and leaps off the building  he begins to wonder . back at the police station  agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions . he informs edwards that is was  in fact  a non-human that he was chasing  and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made . he has edwards identify the gun  and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day . edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process  along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he . after goofing up for half of the time  edwards puts on a show at the firing range  and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the "" criminal "" on foot  which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do . in the meantime  an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter . edgar ( vincent d'onofrio )  owner of the farm  investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object  which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport . the "" bug ""  as he is called  is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors . and it up to the mib  with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war . men in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy  which is usually from will smith  although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film . the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot  as in another big alien film from the past summer . screenwriter ed solomon  writer of super mario bros . and the upcoming x-men film  has surely struck gold with this story . all ages will enjoy men in black . it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again . although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes  the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure . the ending of the film  which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters  is also very well done . a sequel is already being planned  so there is more to look forward to !

"directed by eric rohmer . cast : amanda langlet  arielle dombsale  pascal greggory  fedoor atkine  simon de la brosse  rosette . 1983 - 94 minutes - french - subtitled . rated r ( for nudity and sexual situations ) . reviewed october 5  1998 . by dustin putman  ""  dustin putman's film reviews  "" http : //members . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html eric rohmer's "" pauline at the beach  "" is one of those small  deliberately paced  but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise  but a lot happens to the characters emotionally . the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast  and centers on six different characters  primarily pauline ( amanda langlet )  a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin  marion ( arielle dombasle ) . on the first day at the beach  marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine )  and although he wants to rekindle their relationship  she is more interested in an older  more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory )  who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) . while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults  she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) . "" pauline at the beach  "" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur  and there is not a clear-cut  tidy conclusion to the story . instead  it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life  and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving  and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies  but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's "" my night at mauds  "" and 1971's "" claire's knee "" ) that i have seen  but his direction is assured and intelligent  as is the screenplay  which he also wrote . "" pauline at the beach  "" is a film worth seeing .

"cast : denzel washington  john goodman  donald sutherland  embeth davidtz  james gandolfini  elias koteas director : gregory hoblit producers : charles roven  dawn steel screenplay : nicholas kazan cinematography : newton thomas sigel music : tan dun u . s . distributor : warner brothers call it touched by a demon . gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual  horrific twist . if marketed properly  this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim  dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . in fact  there's even a little twin peaks to be found here  albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . ( remember bob ? ) the biggest failing of fallen is that  although it's consistently interesting  it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia  but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington )  the noblest man on the police force  has brought him to justice . now  during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber  the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes  "" what goes around really goes around . "" shortly thereafter  he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk . minutes later  the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . but for hobbes  the nightmare is just beginning  because reese wasn't a normal psychopath  he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . and  with reese's death  azazel is free to hop from body to body  murdering and wreaking havoc at will . only hobbes and a pretty  female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against . the rest of the cops  including hobbes' partner  jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini )  a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland )  don't have a clue  and  as a result  they are in mortal danger . as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel  philadelphia is a dark  dreary place  a gothic city rather than a modern one . no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks . shadows and night scenes abound . the days are cloudy and unpromising . this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . fallen's plot is brimming with potential  not all of which is realized . somehow  i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . but the level of terror  like that of gore  is kept in check . nevertheless  there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . of the several dozen actors to play azazel  the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica  crash )  who  despite only being on screen for about ten minutes  gives a fantastically charged performance . john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself  although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . sadly  however  these two are the only ones who excel . everyone else  including denzel washington  is boring . washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . it's not that he's bad per se  but he's not very interesting . there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character  and that keeps us distanced  however slightly  from hobbes . as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop  and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate  i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . however  at least washington was believable  which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . to be fair  the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . that said  however  there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts  as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . narratively  fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . although the plot proceeds with a convoluted  game-like structure  it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . at times  this is actually helpful  and it has a use beyond the obvious  but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow . in addition  fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland  generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . however  despite the negatives  i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending  which i loved . the final scenes are startling  audacious  and unexpected . it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes  fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . this is not a great motion picture  but  considering how bad most january releases are  it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . and  whatever you do  don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .

"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward  with a comatose sunny von bulow . she is the main narrator of the film  in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . the dramatic trick works  as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder  sex  unhappiness  and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . jeremy irons is claus von bulow  in what is his finest role  and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . he is as hated as any man alive  as cold as a cucumber . his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant  and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas  1980 . the background to the case is such . during christmas of 1979  sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . the same situation occured in 1980  only sunny never woke  and probably never will . when examined  it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson  convicted  and freed on bail . he immediately hires alan dershowitz  the renowed harvard law professor  to acquit him . ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case  where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit  and von bulow  who he still hasn't figured out . dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny  and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . nevertheless  he does  based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . together with a group of law students  dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . schroeder directs on many different levels  with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . there are flaws ; at times  the film gets overly theatrical . yet  due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow  the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . the flashbacks are good  but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film  and it could have used a better ending . the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly  without any intelligent conclusion . the supporting characters are often neglected  and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise  but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . yet  for all these flaws  the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . as von bulow  he is brutally evil . anti-semitic  prejudiced  arrogant  protective  he is a rotten  lying monster  whose conviction may have been wrong legally  but morally he was to blame . irons plays him to a cold perfection  with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . however  the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness . however  legally  did he do the murder ? schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . with all the character flaws  reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations  and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow  in death . for all the failed dramatic theatrics  this is one that works beautifully . we don't know what happened . that sense of legal ambiguousness  along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt  is why reversalf fortune works . in the end  von bulow is as sadistic as ever . irons is haunting  and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .

"year : 2000 . starring the voices of julia sawalha  mel gibson  miranda richardson  jane horrocks  imelda staunton  tony haygarth  benjamin whitrow . written by peter lord & nick park ( story ) and karey kirkpatrick ( screenplay ) . directed by peter lord and nick park . rated g . i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word . "" fun "" is a noun  and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run . "" no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions  like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere  they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught  subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . one night  a brash american rooster flies in over the fence  calling himself rocky ( mel gibson )  famous flying rooster and circus performer . rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly  and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . she orders a huge pie-making machine  cackling  "" chickens go in ; pies come out . "" what sort of pies ? chicken pies  of course . co-director nick park and his studio  aardman animation  produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts  "" "" the wrong trousers  "" and "" a close shave . "" the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit  a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . "" the wrong trousers  "" for example  pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks  and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . but in the hands of park and his team  the stories felt fresh and inspired  and not the least bit contrived . now teaming with co-director peter lord  park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . "" the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene )  with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . thing is  the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh  alive  like nothing else ever done . part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious  and to them  it is . but they're * chickens *  so it's funny to us . another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . there are references to "" the great escape  "" obviously  and "" stalag 17 . "" the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . "" there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers  "" if you can believe it  and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor  taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it . when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one  "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution . consider this : since july of last year  i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies  on television  on the radio  and online . out of all those  maybe one or two were amusing  the rest tiresome . why ? because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie  "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight  no original idea  no greater purpose . they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise  you got nothing . conversely  "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . if you've never seen "" indiana jones  "" the chase sequence is still fun . even if you have no idea who mel gibson is  rocky remains an interesting character . park  lord  and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood  and as a result  "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious  but not quite vague either . enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history  but if you've got it  "" chicken run "" is that much richer . the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances  and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . ginger is perfect  spunky and opinionated  but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind  and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it . she has warm  human chemistry with gibson  whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived  but sweet . poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way  but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out  and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners  all while perpetually crocheting a sweater )  and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome  but as with most of "" chicken run  "" it comes as a delightful surprise . the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens . the animation is first-rate . remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way  with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit  and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is . this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . as in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug's life "" or "" toy story 2  "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame . certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes  but a active  attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . anyway  the movie's just a boatload of fun . funnest damn movie i've seen all year .

"`blue streak'  martin lawrence's newest outing and first appearance without a big name star by his side ( life  bad boys )  may be cliched and formulaic  but it entertains  none the less . however  be warned that if you're not a martin lawrence fan you should stay far away from this film  as it is carried almost entirely by his comic antics . the story opens with a gang of high-tech thieves led by miles logan breaking into what appears to be a jewelry store . the robbery has just been completed  when one of the gang pulls a double cross and accidentally alerts the police . miles manages to secure the stolen gem in an air duct of an uncompleted building before the police catch him . two years later  released from prison  miles goes back to recover his prize only to discover that the building is now a police station . what is the most obvious solution ? why  to disguise himself as a cop and join the ranks of course . as a by-the-numbers piece of film making  it is fairly easy to guess the outcome of this movie from the start  though i won't reveal it here . in fact  the only things that truly make this worth seeing are the performances by martin lawrence and luke wilson as his likable  yet incredibly naive partner . lawrence's talent stems mainly from his exaggerated speech and facial expressions  and he puts this talent to good use here . just watch his expressions in a scene in which a dozen or so cops have cornered him and are asking what his opinion is about some new piece of police equipment . unfortunately  there are some rather large problems with this movie in addition to the predictable script . first  there are several utterly pointless characters such as melissa green  a defense attorney who appears in only three or four scenes  and is apparently present only so the audience can dislike her . the film's largest annoyance comes from tulley  who is a friend of logan's from the jewel heist . chappelle has such a whiny  obnoxious voice that i saw several people in the audience cringing whenever he spoke . despite these problems  the movie is a lot of fun  and lawrence is clearly having the time of his life making it . i simply hope that next time he finds a more original script to house his rather considerable comic talent . for delivering a lot of chuckles and a few belly laughs  i give `blue streak' three and a half stars and a recommendation to try and catch a matinee . * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made  see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie  hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you've got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain . e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com

"it's an interesting premise . our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . in truth  our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . what we see  what we do  everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . our bodies  severely atrophied  are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network  a sham world  the ability to plug one's brain into a computer  has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator  dark city  and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo  who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . the group's leader  morpheus ( laurence fishburne )  has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . from the beginning of the film  we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . this  in a lesser movie would be annoying  but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . what is reality ? what is a sham ? the film turns our very perception of life on its side . more than once  we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality  or live a life of relative bliss  oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . as viewers  this is intriguing enough  so imagine what it would be like for neo . and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? reeves  whom i've never really cared for as an actor  is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness  and little subtlety . he was good in speed  for example  but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely  so much of my expectation was happily for naught . in a couple of places  the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature  and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . i mean  since bill and ted's excellent adventure  what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? more interesting than reeves is fishburne  who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions  and convincingly so . very surprising for a sci-fi movie . fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout  as if he always knows what to expect . this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge . hugo weaving as agent smith  one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs  is also good playing his deadpan  no-nonsense  kick ass role  which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . unfortunately  when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row  the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . carrie-anne moss plays trinity  morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . although her character is somewhat inconsistent  moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture . there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . many methods of imagery are employed  from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen  turned  then continued from a new angle . this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle  with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . the motion cameras film the action  and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . pretty slick . the matrix drips with style . from the clothing to the music to the action  we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to . much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu  there's a lot of gunplay . when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon  much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados )  especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . combined  it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen . the film is not without its faults . some of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films  and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance  a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying  and it wasn't meant to be a joke . however  these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .

"the happy bastard's quick movie reviewfor a minute there  i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest  another adaptation of a legend from the past . ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? yikes ! ) but guess what- disney  a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films  strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who's lost her young adopts him into her group . as he matures into a much older man  tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan  and then arrives a hunter  a professor  and the professor's lovely daughter  jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . from there  tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? the voicework here is pretty top-level . tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne "" newman "" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . the movie is superb throughout  mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one  i might add )  the camera twists and turns  allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . and the music's not half bad  either . fortunately  there's no ridiculous singing characters here  just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . there's some great action sequences here as well  including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan  jane  and the aforementioned babboons . but  of course  it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family . this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library . . . that is  if my vcr still works in the year 2000 .

"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . o . j . simpson  tom capano  the menendez brothers . all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . and  of course  courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas  the courtroom has always provided big bucks . so when i rented a civil action  i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker  a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . however  what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected  a major surprise  but fortunately  a pleasant one . john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . no one expected him to light up the screen in grease  nor in saturday night fever . but  whenever he gets knocked down  he always seems to come back fighting . a civil action is not john's best performance  but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . his performance is not flashy  nor memorable  just solid . if he delivered the only solid performance  this film would still be average . luckily  he has a strong supporting cast . william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . he continues to deliver great performances one after the other  but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . in a civil action  he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant . he is not a lovable character  but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . he is not one of the big time lawyers  just a measly accountant . but  he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998  but there is actually someone better in a civil action . robert duvall is also an underrated actor . he gets many leading roles  but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks  brad pitt and jim carrey . duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . duvall is magical in this role . he is the wise teacher  who not only battles it out in the courtroom  but also manages to teach every major player a lesson  in his own twisted way . in many non-comedic films  directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy  to keep the audience on their toes . unfortunately  they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks  anyone ? ) . however  this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . this is not the case in a civil action . they have comedy coming from all sides . whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger  the laughs come in a steady pace . granted  it's not roll in the aisle funny  but it provides a nice addition to the film . the plot is terrific- somewhat . the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . however  budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . i will not spoil the rest  although i must speak of the one downside to the film . the courtroom debates are great  but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . it left me somewhat confused  although the rest of the film is terrific . all in all  john travolta is back yet again in this great film . his supporting cast  consisting of macy and duvall  turn in tremendous performances  which ease the load on travolta . the film is smart  witty and thought provoking . not only does it gauge in-court battles  but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .

"" when the film opens  it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections  and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . in a fit of desperation  he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee )  and then hires a hit man to kill him  although he doesn't know who the assassin will be  or when the hit will take place . knowing that he will soon be dead  bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world  which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . at a compton church  he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings  and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . "" later  in a particularly hilarious sequence  bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite  then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . "" all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade  bulworth's chief of staff  dennis murphy ( oliver platt )  follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes  as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . when bulworth decides he wants to live after all  and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn  he hides out in the ghetto  complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . at this point  beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry )  who he meets at the harlem church rally . she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . ( don cheadle of "" boogie nights "" )  who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign . some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true  but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz'n'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) . "" bulworth's "" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . instead of speaking at political rallies  he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad  or whether he's actually that incompetent . at any rate  the rap sounds more run d . m . c . than snoop doggy dogg  which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches  instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . other than that  "" bulworth "" hits all its targets with wry  hilarious accuracy . the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party  and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government  it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . unlike "" primary colors "" which opened earlier this year  "" bulworth "" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead  it takes them dead-on .

"what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : "" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman  and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! "" and  indeed  this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding  oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series ) . on one hand  nicholson's joker is extremely funny . his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . but on the other hand  his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . the joker's cruelty and demented  diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . this guy is off his rocker  and he not only knows it  he flaunts it ! but enough about nicholson as the joker : i'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . like many  i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . but batfans need not worry becauseholy unconventional casting ! keaton delivers . he is convincing as the tormented millionaire  bruce wayne  and beneath his hard  black body armor  he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character  keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . visually  batman is a knockoutnothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak  gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as "" the dark knight returns "" and "" the killing joke . "" burton's film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . the sets  costumes  and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . nicholson isn't joking when he boasts  "" wait 'till they get a load of me ! "" his grimacing smile  green hair  and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . keaton's wardrobe is equally appropriate . batman's cape  mask  and body armor make him look threatening  frightening  and invinciblebringing to mind not adam west's campy costume in the tv series but peter weir's outfit in robocop . production designer anton furst's sets are a wonder . gotham city is dark and foreboding  almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . the batcave is cold  bare  and desolate . the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . the movie's gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . the plot  on the other hand  is not as rousing . the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology  but it fails to give us enough of either one . as i mentioned earlier  the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker  but it never fully establishes batman's psychological motives and underpinnings . in terms of action  batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . more than anything  batman is a mood film . while batman may not completely absorb and excite you  it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . thanks to its distinctive look  the movielike a good comic booktransports us to another world .
